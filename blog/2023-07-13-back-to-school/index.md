# Push Grants for Collaborations with University Students

<b>
    Weâ€™re extremely excited to announce a brand new initiative designed to enhance collaboration between Push Protocol and university students!
</b>

Universities are at the forefront of innovation, and weâ€™re launching a grant program called <b><i>Back2School w/ Push</i></b> to empower students to build, learn, and educate others on cutting-edge web3 development.

As such, eligible event for the Push Back2School grants include:

- Interested university students or tech clubs
- University based web3 workshops
- University based web3 hackathons
- University based community/web3 educational activities
- And any other ideas you want to apply for!
  In this way, the Back2School grants are available to virtually <b><i>any type</i></b> of activity or event that involves building, educating, and advocating web3.

The program is <b><i>open to students from all academic levels</i></b> and backgrounds, and grants will be awarded based on the scope of events, complexity, potential impact, and localization. Grant recipients will have access to financial support, mentorship and guidance, resources and infrastructure, recognition and visibility from the Push Protocol team.
