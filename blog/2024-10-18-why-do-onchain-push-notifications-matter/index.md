<!-- truncate -->

In the fast-moving Web3 space, new developments and breakthroughs emerge at breakneck speeds, so staying informed and ahead of the curve is essential. However, most decentralized applications (dApps) lack native notification systems, leaving users in the dark when critical on-chain events occur. This is where push notifications, an on-chain communications primitive developed by Push Protocol, become crucial.

## **dApps Lack Native Notifications**

Most Web3 applications operate in a decentralized manner. They often don't include native push notifications like their Web2 counterparts (aka notifications you would receive from apps like WhatsApp or X). In the case of traditional apps, push notifications keep users updated on essential activities—whether it's a message from a friend or a reminder to pay bills. dApps, by contrast, typically require users to manually check their wallets or dashboards for updates, creating a less-than-user-friendly experience.

Without notifications, users can easily miss key events like:

- **Price movements of their favorite assets**
- **Governance proposal updates in DAOs**
- **Liquidation alerts in DeFi platforms**
- **The latest publications from their chosen web3 news platform**

This gap is more than a mere inconvenience; it affects user engagement, asset security, and decision-making.

## **So Why Do On-Chain Push Notifications Matter?**

Let's break it down below:

### **1. Real-Time Awareness for Time-Sensitive Actions**

On-chain push notifications ensure users never miss important events that require immediate attention. Whether it's an impending liquidation in a DeFi protocol or a time-sensitive governance vote in a DAO, notifications can help users act quickly.

### **2. Improving UX in Decentralized Applications**

Push notifications are an integral part of modern user experience (UX) design. By integrating on-chain notifications, dApps can bring a more familiar and seamless experience to users. This can reduce the friction typically associated with interacting with decentralized applications.

### **3. Push is Everywhere, For Every Use Case**

Push Protocol’s notifications are **multi-platform**, meaning users can receive alerts in their wallets, on their smartphones, and inside of other dApps. To date, Push Protocol has deployments on Android, iOS, and wallets like MetaMask and Unstoppable Domains. This flexibility ensures that users stay updated on anything passed through the channels they subscribe to, no matter where they are or which device they're using.

## **How Can Push Notifications Enhance Your On-Chain Experience?**

Push notifications are a huge unlock for both developers of decentralized applications and their users/communities. Below we will highlight some of the widespread use cases of push notifications, and some more innovative and niche use cases.

### **Governance and DAOs**

In decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), push notifications can be utilized to update members on proposal submissions, voting deadlines, and vote outcomes, ensuring more informed and timely participation across all areas of the DAOs involved.

- **Benefits:** Increases voter turnout and improves participation in governance activities.
- **Use Case:** DAOs like Push DAO and Shapeshift DAO can use push notifications to inform members about any events and outcomes desired, ensuring that critical decisions receive the maximum level of timely attention.
