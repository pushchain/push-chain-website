The **Rockstars of EPNS** is our gratitude collection of 100 NFTs commissioned by Indian artists to show our appreciation for the incredible support of the Push community. 48, out of the 100 NFTs were gifted to our early advisors, supporters, and evangelists of the EPNS protocol who helped us reach so many milestones. The remaining 52 NFTs were allocated for community members.\\n\\nWe are proud to have these 52 well-wishers & supporters of EPNS who have contributed to the project in several ways.\\n\\n**Community-chosen winners**\\n\\nThe initial 24 Rockstars of EPNS were chosen by the EPNS team internally by carefully scrutinizing the submissions. Later, towards our efforts to make the platform progressively decentralized, the Push Governance community started choosing the winners among the nominations through governance voting. This made sure that the community\u2019s voice is heard.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\n**1\\\\. Token Gated Channel**\\n\\nTo nurture & grow this community of OG supporters of EPNS, an exclusive channel is created on Discord which you can join by verifying your Rockstar NFT. These channel members would be the first to get all the major upcoming alpha drops about EPNS. [Here is the guide on \u2018How to join the token gated discord\u2019](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/token-gated-channel-for-our-rockstar-community-db05bcb21778).\\n\\n**2\\\\. Opportunities with Community Tipping**\\n\\nWith 53% of PUSH allocated to the community, we plan on giving PUSH to the hands of the community in various ways. Major progress has been made in setting up a tipping tool called Coordinape. The [proposal](https://gov.epns.io/t/pip-04-coordinape-tipping-for-push-governance-community/543) to set up the same is in the Push Governance Process now(Make sure to [checkout](https://gov.epns.io/t/pip-04-coordinape-tipping-for-push-governance-community/543) & give feedback!). With that being said, we invite all the OG supporters of EPNS, the Rockstar Winners to continue supporting us & get incentivized via tipping.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Governance Engagement**\\n\\nPush Governance in the long run would be an inevitable part of EPNS that drives the protocol. As we move towards that goal, we invite the Rockstars to hold the baton for Push Governance, be the community leaders & engage in all Push Governance activities ([Forum](https://gov.epns.io/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/YVPB99F9W5)).\\n\\n## Thank you!\\n\\nAfter 52 weeks together, to thank all of you adequately is impossible. All your time spent and efforts help strengthen ourselves as a community as a whole.  \\nWe can\u2019t wait to take together the next steps in bringing Web3 communication to new heights. Once again, thank you!\\n\\nOur deepest gratitude,  \\nThe EPNS team\\n\\n#KeepPUSHing"}}')}}]);
