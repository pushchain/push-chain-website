As our ambitions grew beyond just notifications, we felt we needed a brand refresh that would better accommodate our vision of becoming web3\u2019s most widely used communication protocol.\\n\\nAnd so far, people seem to love it.\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\", aspectRatio: \'56.25%\' }} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiC-nbg9Iuk\\" title=\\"EPNS Rebrands into Push Protocol \u2014 the Communication Protocol for Web3\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\nA fantastic rebrand however needs similarly fantastic project developments behind it. This started included:\\n\\n- Push going live on [Ethereum](https://medium.com/push-protocol/the-epns-mainnet-is-here-470faec0c01) mainnet in January.\\n- Completed our Series A round and honored to have some amazing [investors](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1514632659514798081) help us realize our vision.\\n- Many exciting product developments followed including the launch of the [SNS](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-sns-for-push-delivery-nodes-quickest-way-to-bootstrap-your-wallet-app-or-any-c88017595e09) module for Push Delivery Nodes and the release of [SDK monorepo](https://medium.com/push-protocol/here-comes-the-all-new-epns-sdk-monorepo-framework-8447b486a801) structure. Both these developments were aimed at creating a seamless experience for developers.\\n- We launched on [Polygon](https://blockworks.co/news/polygon-onboards-new-web3-native-communication-network), adding it to our expanding list of supported chains.\\n- Our most awaited product, [Push Chat](https://medium.com/push-protocol/were-still-pushing-a-deeper-look-into-push-chat-90fdea8d9e8e) went live in alpha and with it, we took a huge step in facilitating wallet-to-wallet communication in web3.\\n\\nSince going live with all these features, we\u2019ve seen increased adoption and utility of the Push protocol.\\n\\n## Push by the Numbers\ud83d\udcc8\\n\\n2022 saw more notifications, live channels, and channel subscribers than we\u2019ve ever had before.\\n\\nAs we\u2019ve continued to refine, improve, and develop our communication tools, more protocols are harnessing the power of notifications than ever before \u2014 and we\u2019re happy to be leading the way. In fact, in Q1 and Q3 Push saw more than 20%+ QoQ growth.\\n\\nWe went [live on Polygon in September](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-protocol-launches-on-polygon-enabling-communication-for-thousands-of-dapps-1c49d7c996f8) and [live on Lens in October](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-and-lens-powering-ux-with-notifications-and-aaves-lens-85828638e691), giving Push a huge boost in the way of reach and utility.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a look at the numbers:\\n\\n![Push Growth](./image-1.png)\\n<ImageText>Push Growth Overview</ImageText>\\n\\n![Notifications](./image-2.png)\\n<ImageText>Number of Push Notifications \u2014 Powered by </ImageText>\\n\\n## The Push Fam Continues to Expand \ud83c\udf31\\n\\n2022 was a fantastic year for making new frens and building new partnerships. Some of the most renowned projects in the web3 space joined forces with us to enable decentralized communication on their dApps.\\n\\nWe are thrilled to be working with some of the most ambitious projects in web3 and enabling native web3 communication for their protocols.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a look at our ecosystem today:\\n\\n![Ecosystem](./image-3.png)\\n<ImageText>Frens of Push 2022</ImageText>\\n\\n## IRL Events\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\\n\\n2022 kept us busy with a long list of conferences and events. We were honored to be able to attend some of the most prestigious conferences and hackathons this year and get to meet a lot of our community in person.\\n\\nWe attended ETHDenver, Devconnect, ETHAmsterdam, ETHNewYork, EthCC, Unfold, Devcon Bogot\xe1, ETHSF, and ETHIndia, and co-hosted [Zero-to-Dapp conference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyWTqFLqKt9ZJOmEsEbkrn1nPCy69INhl) along with The Graph, Arbitrum, and Router.\\n\\nNeedless to say, it was a busy year with tons of new projects building with Push and bounties being won.\\n\\n![Developer Adoption](./image-4.png)\\n<ImageText>Developer Adoption of Push in 2022</ImageText>\\n\\nThank you to everyone who invited us to teach, discuss, and demo our ideas, as well as everyone who showed up to the events to meet the Push team and build using Push.\\n\\nHere are a few sights from hackathons this year:\\n\\n![EthIndia1](./image-5.jpg)\\n![EthIndia2](./image-6.jpg)\\n![EthIndia3](./image-7.jpg)\\n![EthIndia4](./image-8.jpg)\\n\\n## Push in the News\ud83d\udcf0\\n\\nWith all the progress Push had this year, publications took note. A host of our launches and collaborations were featured in a variety of prominent publications.\\n\\nSome of our favorite headlines were:\\n\\n- CoinDesk: [EPNS Goes Live in Bid to Bring Notifications to Web 3](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/11/epns-goes-live-in-bid-to-bring-notifications-to-web-3/)\\n- CoinDesk: [Ethereum Push Notification Service Raises $10M at $131M Valuation](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/04/14/ethereum-push-notification-service-raises-10m-at-131m-valuation/)\\n- Benzinga: [Ethereum\u2019s Communication Layer EPNS: Interview With Co-Founder Harsh Rajat At EthCC 5 Paris](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/07/28227776/ethereums-communication-layer-epns-interview-with-co-founder-harsh-rajat-at-ethcc-5-paris)\\n- Blockworks: [Polygon Onboards New Web3-native Communication Network](https://blockworks.co/news/polygon-onboards-new-web3-native-communication-network)\\n\\n## Our Community, Our Strength\ud83e\udd1d\\n\\nCommunity is everything for Push, and 2022 would not have been such a successful year without your help. To all the devs who built using Push, all $PUSH token holders, and users who subscribe to channels \u2014 we thank you for being a part of our community!\\n\\nTo foster our community\u2019s growth, we started the [Push Grants Program](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-grants-program-its-here-f2bfba29388f) earlier this year with the goal of funding builders in the web3 space. With feedback and learnings from the first iteration of the program, [PGP v2.0](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1604867953190739973) went live later this year and we\u2019ve seen tons of projects begin to apply.\\n\\n![PGP V2](./image-9.webp)\\n\\nBeyond just community growth, we also wanted to better involve the community in the improvement of Push. To streamline feature requests, we launched [Push Improvement Proposal](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-push-improvement-proposal-pip-702c44fc24f6) to create an open forum to discuss proposals for standardized, community-driven improvements in the Push ecosystem.\\n\\n![PIP](./image-10.webp)\\n\\nPush now has new initiatives for fostering Push notifications and chat integration, community-led improvements to the protocol, and community growth.\\n\\nWe have no doubt setting these initiatives up in 2022 is going to lead to a massive year for us in 2023!\\n\\n## You\u2019re the Real Rockstars\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfa4\\n\\nWe launched the second version of Push Rockstars this year: Rockstars Of Push Vol. 2 and had 24 winners to date, 100+ submissions, and over 20M+ of $PUSH token voting!\\n\\nFrom educational threads to YouTube demos, the Push community never failed to surprise us with fantastic Push-related content.\\n\\nThanks to all the Rockstars of Push for your love and ongoing support.\\n\\n## What\u2019s Next for Us?\ud83d\ude80\\n\\nAs always, we continue to build.\\n\\nEverything we\u2019ve done this year has been a stepping stone to prepare us for a massive 2023. We\u2019ll be looking to set new records for Push integrations, utility, and partnerships, all while bringing exciting new developments that best serve the communication needs of web3.\\n\\nHappy Holidays from the Push team, and we look forward to building with you in 2023.\\n\\n![Offsite](./image-11.jpg)"}}')}}]);
