With over 5000 members from around the world, D_D continues to accelerate its mission of empowering a new wave of Web3 builders through constant innovations and educational efforts.\\n\\nWe are excited to have Developer DAO as a part of the Push ecosystem and look forward to enhancing the community experience via decentralized communication. This is only the start of an amazing journey with D_D!\\n\\n## Developer DAO X Push: What to expect\\n\\nFacilitating a culture of \u201clearning and growing together\u201d is a cornerstone mission of D_D. With this in mind, the importance of streamlined community participation and governance is critical to the community\u2019s success. This is where Push comes in.\\n\\nPush Protocol addresses this user experience problem by providing a communication layer for wallets and dapps. Push allows any dapp, smart contract, backend, protocol, or, in principle, any distributed technology to send communication directly to user wallet addresses in an open and decentralized way. Being an open and permissionless protocol, anyone can create dedicated channels to distribute information directly to user wallets without needing to rely on centralized service providers.\\n\\n### Push x D_D channel soon!\\n\\nBy creating a communication channel for D_D members, Push aims to encourage maximum participation by DAO members. Push will notify:\\n\\n- When there is a new proposal on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth)\\n- 24 hrs before the proposal voting ends\\n- When there is a new Proposal topic created on the [D_D forum](https://forum.developerdao.com/c/proposals/5)\\n- When a Substack newsletter or blog post is live\\n\\nD_D official channel will be live on [Push](https://app.push.org/) on Dec 13th. Members can simply opt-in and stay up-to-date with all the latest updates from Developer DAO.\\n\\nKeep an eye out for all the surprises and exclusive events we have for the D_D community.\\n\\n### Push workshop: Power your Web3 app with Push\\n\\nWe\u2019re pulling together an awesome <b>1-hour workshop</b> for the D_D community with our founder [Harsh](https://twitter.com/harshrajat) and core dev [Fabio](https://twitter.com/learn4life6).\\n\\nWhether you are just entering the space, an experienced developer, or an indie hacker, we will help you understand our tech and learn how to use Push Protocol to power your web3 app through a hands-on workshop. This includes sending out decentralized notifications and integrating chat functionality for the Web3 applications you\u2019re building.\\n\\n\ud83d\udcc5 Date: December 14th, 2022\\n\\n\ud83d\udd50 Time: 5:00 PM UTC = 10:30 PM IST\\n\\n\ud83c\udfab Register for the event here.\\n\\n\ud83d\udccd Location: [Developer DAO Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qzbGkGNR?event=1044770824135114823)\\n\\n[Doveloper DAO x Push Protocol](https://twitter.com/developer_dao/status/1600576379145306114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1600576379145306114%7Ctwgr%5Eb13769eb1bdf2a6c38faf9ec5ada9c60b0d4dd72%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fdeveloper_dao%2Fstatus%2F1600576379145306114image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\\n\\n### Surprise giveaway \ud83d\udc40\\n\\nPush will be offering an exclusive surprise to all D_D members\u2014 details of the surprise will be released via the [D_D Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qzbGkGNR?event=1044770824135114823) 1 day before the workshop, so stay tuned.\\n\\nBe sure to join the workshop and drop any questions you might have in the #pushprotocol channel in the D_D Discord (under \u201ctechnical discussion\u201d).\\n\\nSee you at the workshop!"}}')}}]);
