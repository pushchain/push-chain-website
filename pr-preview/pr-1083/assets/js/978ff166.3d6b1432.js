Blockchain agnostic wallet addresses\\n\\nFor Apps to support users from any chain and achieve **universal compatibility** - there must be a way to identify, interpret and transact with addresses incoming from various chains.\\n\\nAs a shared-state blockchain, Push Chain is designed to parse and handle blockchain addresses alongside the specific chains they originate from.\\n\\nFor instance, Push Chain can identify and support Solana, EVM, Cosmos and any other chain\u2019s addresses.\\nTo achieve this, Push Chain fully adopts [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) blockchain-agnostic wallet addresses, enabling it to deduce the chain, network, and address associated with each transaction ensuring universal compatibility across multiple blockchain ecosystems.\\n\\n### 2. Support Txns from any chain\\n\\nIn addition to parsing addresses across various chains, Push Chain supports transactions from any wallet, regardless of the originating chain\u2014be it Ethereum, Solana, or any other network.\\n\\nPush Chain achieves this by accepting signed payload data and supporting the native signers of individual chains. Validator nodes then verify these signatures \u2192 conduct pre-transaction checks (such as fee validation) \u2192 and then admit the transactions to the network.\\n\\n\x3c!-- Here\u2019s a quick demo of an app that lets you send transactions to Push Chain from any chain of your choice.\\n\\n\\n<video width=\\"640\\" height=\\"360\\" controls>\\n  <source src=\\"./simulate_push_chain.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video> --\x3e\\n\\nTo clarify, a user doesn\u2019t have to \u201cbridge\u201d to another chain to use our platform. Instead, the app becomes universal and available to all users of any chain.\\n\\n### 3. Universal Fee Abstraction\\n\\nWith web3\u2019s progression towards true interoperability, the necessity to hold native tokens for basic interactions creates unnecessary barriers in what should be a borderless ecosystem.\\n\\n**Push Chain\u2019s Fee Abstraction eliminates these digital borders, ensuring universal accessibility and removing the economic friction of owning native tokens for network fees.**\\n\\n- **Universal Gateway Contracts**<br />\\n  Fee contracts on every chain convert native tokens to cover fees automatically\u2014no explicit swaps for Push Chain\u2019s tokens are required.\\n\\n- **Bulk Fee Payments**<br />\\n  Lock and release fees in bulk, then send them to Push Chain directly in the transaction. This removes the bottleneck of waiting on a specific blockchain\u2019s speed.\\n\\n- **Delegated Fees**<br />\\n  Wallets or web3 apps can cover fees, enabling a web2-like UX where the \u201cwebsite\u201d pays for the user.\\n\\nThese mechanisms bridge web2 paradigms into web3 enabling web2 UX in a web3 world enabling any user of any chain to simply interact with the app and not have to worry about the fees.\\n\\n### 4. Wallet abstraction\\n\\nWallet abstraction provides a flexible, **embeddable wallet experience**, tailored to individual user journeys enabling any wallet from any chain to connect, interact and transact with Push Chain.\\n\\n- **Degens (aka existing web3 users)**<br />\\n  Well accustomed to the fragmented UX, have app & chain specific preferences for every on-chain activity. These users already are using wallets like Metamask, Phantom, etc and are already in a blockchain ecosystem like Ethereum, Solana, etc.\\n\\n  For these users, Push Chain provides a seamless onboarding experience by allowing them to use their existing wallets like Metamask, Phantom, etc along with whatever native chain they are on for both sending transactions and funding the fees.\\n\\n- **Normies (aka new web3 users)**<br />\\n  New or casual users unfamiliar with web3 complexities. Ones who are not comfortable with the idea of setting up a wallet.\\n\\n  For these users, Push Chain offers a seamless onboarding experience by allowing them to use their email or social account to connect to the app and transact with Push Chain.\\n\\n### 5. Single Transaction, no matter the chain\\n\\nUser experience is the most important part of any app. Creating a powerful tech stack is only half the battle. Which is why Push Chain only ever requires a single transaction to be sent by the user, no matter from which chain they choose to interact with the app.\\n\\nThis is made possible by optimizing the transaction flow to be as simple as possible.\\n\\n- **New wallet of another chain doing a transaction** - Transaction hash is bundle with fee locking on universal gateway contracts ensuring single transaction.\\n\\n- **Existing (onboarded) wallet of another chain doing a transaction** - If the wallet has enough gas, the universal gateway contract is surpassed and the transaction is sent directly to the chain.\\n\\n### 6. Universal Smart Contracts\\n\\nPush Chain is a fully EVM compatible chain. Any EVM compatible smart contract can be deployed on Push Chain with **zero on-chain code changes** to instantly become compatible with all L1s (including non-EVM chains).\\n\\nJust deploy in minutes and instantly 10x your userbase.\\n\\n### 7. True Identity and Cross-Chain Mapping\\n\\nContracts on Push Chain automatically recognize the wallet of the user and the chain they are on. This allows the contracts to know the entire state of the user and the chain they are on enabling developers to create apps that were not possible before.\\n\\nImagine multi-chain enabled safes, prediction markets accessible by all users, poker games played between different chains, defi that can tap into liquidity from all chains, and so much more!\\n\\n### 8. Shared State and Programmable Solvers (Roadmap)\\n\\n\x3c!-- shared state diagram --\x3e\\n\\n![shared state diagram](./image2.webp)\\n\\n- **Shared State**<br />\\n\\nShared state allows Push Chain to access data from any supported external chains in the smart contract, further giving power to developers to enquire and act on the state of a wallet or a smart contract from any other chain.\\n\\nWith shared state, you can read wallet activities like NFTs, DeFi positions, governance participation, and so much more!\\n\\n- **Programmable Solvers**<br />\\n\\nProgrammable solvers on the other hand enables developers to give atomic instructions of what they want to execute on other chains from the smart contract.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWe started from users of any chain able to access app on Push Chain but once Push is done - we will finally see a world where users of any chain are able to interact with apps on any other chain.\\n\\nAll while making sure that the developers or users don\'t pay a price for it - neither in terms of learning curve, multiple deployments, maintaining multiple codebases or complexity of the code.\\n\\n**Let\'s Build Universal Apps!**"}}')}}]);
