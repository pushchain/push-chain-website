Crowdsourced from Push Fam \ud83e\udef6 and curated by the Push team \ud83d\udcaa.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What is Push Chain?\\n\\nPush Chain is a shared-state Layer 1 blockchain built to eliminate fragmentation across all chains.\\n\\nBy enabling **seamless transactions from any chain** (Ethereum, Solana, EVM or non-EVM), it lets any user interact with web3 apps without juggling multiple wallets, tokens or gas mechanics.\\n\\nIn short, Push Chain unites L1s \ud83e\udd1d L2s \ud83e\udd1d L3s under one cohesive layer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How does Push Chain work?\\n\\n![How Normal Apps Work](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/faq/normalapps.webp)\\n![How Universal Apps Work](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/faq/universalapps.webp)\\n\\nPush Chain takes a unique approach to solving the problem of fragmentation across all chains. Instead of creating interop protocol which comes with complexities for both users and developers, it takes a novel approach by building a true universal blockchain that can be natively used by any user from any chain.\\n\\nTo achieve this, Push Chain leverages several **precompiles** which are custom modules created to:\\n\\n1. **Recognize** users of other chains - Universal address standard that extends the address of a user to be blockchain agnostic (based on [CAIP-10 standards](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md)).\\n\\n2. **Map** users to Push Chain - This is done by deploying a smart account called UEA (Universal Executor Account) for each user of a different chain. This module is used to deploy a smart account that then uses other precompiles to process the transactions.\\n\\n3. **Execute** universal transactions - This is done by using USV (Universal Signature Verification) and UTXV (Universal Transaction Verifier) precompiles to verify and execute signatures and transactions from other chains.\\n\\n4. **Abstract** away the complexities of the chain they are on - This is done by having universal gateway contracts on each chain that locks gas funds in native token of the chain (or any other compliant token) and then uses the UTXV precompiles to attribute the gas to UEA (Executor Account) and USV to execute the transaction.\\n\\nThis is an **extremely powerful approach** that allows users to interact with any app on Push Chain without worrying about the chain they are on or what wallet they are using as everything is abstracted away, for both the users and the developers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Why is Push Chain unique for users?\\n\\nPush Chain addresses specific gaps in the existing blockchains, such as interoperability, state access across chains, programmable solvers and wallet abstraction resulting in a **full stack interop**. While existing blockchains are robust, they operate in their own eco-system and an aggregator to unite these chains are needed.\\n\\nPush Chain\u2019s focus is on being a **shared state chain** for universal (interoperable) applications acting as a unifying layer where all chains can come together and use PC as universal hub or do settlement between them.\\n\\nIt offers a new paradigm of web3 that works from **Any Chain.** For **Any Wallet / User.** And is suitable for **Any App.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What are the core innovations of Push Chain?\\n\\n![Push Chain Architecture](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/faq/pcoverview.webp)\\n\\nPush Chain is a Proof-of-Stake Layer 1 designed to eliminate fragmentation across every blockchain. Under the hood, it combines several key innovations:\\n\\n- **True Universal Chain**  \\n  Natively supports all chains and enables users to interact with the same app. No centralized relayers, bridges, or other hacks needed.\\n\\n- **Universal Fee & Wallet Abstraction**  \\n  Allows users to interact with the app from any chain without worrying about gas or wallet mechanics.\\n\\n- **Single transaction for any chain**  \\n  Users only ever sign a single transaction, no matter from what chain they are interacting from.\\n\\n- **Universal Smart Contracts**  \\n  100% EVM compatible smart contracts that can be deployed with **zero on-chain code changes**. Once deployed, they become instantly compatible with users of all chains.\\n\\n- **Universal EVM**  \\n  Push Chain is smart enough to natively recognize users of other chains and correctly attributes and maps the transactions to them.\\n\\n- **Shared State and Programmable Solvers**  \\n  (Roadmap) Enables smart contracts of Push Chain to read and write state to any other chain.\\n\\nTogether, these features let you build **universal web3 apps**. Instead of \u201cUniswap on Ethereum\u201d or \u201cUniswap on Polygon,\u201d a user simply becomes **user of Uniswap**\u2014period.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What problems does Push Chain solve?\\n\\n- **Fragmentation**  \\n  Unites EVM & non-EVM chains under one shared-state L1, so users never need to hop networks or wallets.\\n\\n- **Interoperability**  \\n  Native support for transactions from any blockchain and on-chain shared state.\\n\\n- **Finality**  \\n  Instant, irreversible native finality in ~1\u20132 seconds\u2014no more waiting or reorgs.\\n\\n- **Onboarding & UX**  \\n  Social/email login, gas-in-any-token & any-wallet support for zero-friction access across chains.\\n\\n- **Universal Apps**  \\n  Build once, deploy everywhere \u2014 any web3 app works seamlessly for any user on any chain.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What are the apps that can be built on Push Chain?\\n\\n![Universal App Examples](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/faq/appusecases.webp)\\n\\nPush Chain brings seamless interoperability and unifies all L1s \ud83e\udd1d L2s \ud83e\udd1d L3s. It is poised to become the playground of innovation and interop.\\n\\nYou can build and better existing web3 use cases such as:\\n\\n- **Universal Dex** - Abstracted swap on any chain giving a CEX experience with chain security\\n- **Universal DeFi** - DeFi 3.0 can be unlocked that can become a universal bank across all chains.\\n- **Universal AI Agents** - Launch AI agents with universal payment support (any token, any chain)\\n- **Universal DAOs** - DAOs that are compatible with every chain and can be used to vote on proposals without blockchain silos\\n- **Universal Gaming** - Players of any chains can have unified tournaments or gaming session\\n- **Universal Marketplaces** - Marketplaces where players or NFTs of any chains can be traded\\n- **Universal Name Service** - Naming service that can resolve to multiple wallets\\n\\nThe apps and innovations that can happen on Push Chain are endless! Here are some [more use cases](/blog/consumer-apps-that-can-be-built-on-push-chain/) to get you started.\\n\\nBuilders can also check out the [Documentation Hub](/docs/) to get started.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Technical\\n\\n### Why does Push Chain need to be an L1 instead of an L2 chain?\\n\\nPush Chain is built to serve as a **shared settlement layer** and **universal execution layer** for all other blockchains\u2014roles that only a standalone L1 can fulfill:\\n\\n- **Native Cross-Chain Settlement**  \\n  As an L1, Push Chain can directly finalize transactions from any chain without relying on a separate security or fraud-proof model.\\n\\n- **Universal Execution & State Access**  \\n  Running its own consensus and state machine lets Push Chain interpret and execute transactions from Ethereum, Solana, and beyond\u2014something an L2 (tied to a single base layer) cannot do natively.\\n\\n- **No L2 Constraints or Delays**  \\n  L2s inherit the latency, finality rules, and gas model of their host chain (plus bridging overhead). Push Chain avoids those bottlenecks by offering instant finality and fee abstraction on its own.\\n\\n- **True Shared State**  \\n  To read & write the state of multiple chains within smart contracts, you need direct, protocol-level access\u2014only available at the L1 layer.\\n\\nIn short, only a purpose-built L1 can unify every chain under one cohesive execution and settlement layer without introducing extra complexity or trust assumptions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Is Push Chain EVM Compatible?\\n\\nAbsolutely! Push Chain is fully EVM compatible. You can deploy any EVM smart contract with **zero on-chain code changes**, and it will run seamlessly for users across all integrated chains (both EVM and non-EVM).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Will Push Chain be compatible with both EVM and non-EVM chains?\\n\\nYes! Push Chain is built to bridge every blockchain paradigm.\\n\\n- **EVM Compatibility**  \\n  Drop in your Solidity contracts and they run unchanged, leveraging Push Chain\u2019s EVM runtime.\\n\\n- **Non-EVM Support**  \\n  Native precompiles (USV/UTXV) and the universal address standard let Push Chain validate and execute transactions from Solana, Bitcoin, Cosmos SDK chains, and more.\\n\\nIn practice, users and apps from any chain can interact with Push Chain apps seamlessly \u2014 no matter the underlying VM.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Why create a new blockchain when existing ones like Ethereum and Solana already exist?\\n\\nPush Chain fills critical gaps that today\u2019s blockchains, despite being robust, don\u2019t address:\\n\\n- **Interoperability**  \\n  Existing networks operate in silos, making cross-chain data and asset transfers cumbersome.\\n\\n- **Zero-Friction UX**  \\n  Forget switching wallets or buying chain-specific gas. Social/email login + pay-with-any-token means users jump straight into apps without any onboarding hurdles.\\n\\n- **Shared App Experience**  \\n  With every user on the same Push Chain, your app feels like one cohesive product, not a patchwork of \u201cUniswap on X\u201d or \u201cUniswap on Y\u201d.\\n\\n- **Universal Execution Layer**  \\n  No single chain today can natively run transactions and smart contracts that support users from any chain.\\n\\nPush Chain is designed as a **shared-state L1 for universal applications**, unifying state and execution across EVM and non-EVM ecosystems. **The result?** Seamless cross-chain interactions and truly universal apps that any user on any chain can access without friction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What does shared state blockchain mean?\\n\\nShared state refers to the present status of onchain data. A shared-state blockchain is one that has read-and-write access to its own state and the state of all other chains it interacts with.\\n\\nA shared state chain is capable of handling data, liquidity, and users from any other chain.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How does Push Chain achieve shared state?\\n\\n![Push Chain Universal App](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/faq/pcuniversalapp.webp)\\n\\nA traditional blockchain only knows its own ledger and wallet standard. Push Chain extends that model in four key ways:\\n\\n1. **Universal Wallet Compatibility**\\n\\n- Supports chain agnostic addresses from any chain (Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, Cosmos SDK, etc.)\\n- Signatures from any chain are verified via USV/UTXV precompiles, so users never switch wallets.\\n\\n2. **Universal Smart Contracts**\\n\\n- EVM contracts deploy unchanged but can natively verify and execute cross-chain transactions.\\n- Push Chain\u2019s runtime handles signature mapping and payload parsing for every supported network.\\n\\n3. **On-Chain Shared State**\\n\\n- Validators commit Merkle proofs of external chain state (via MPT roots) each block.\\n- Relayers fetch and submit leaf proofs on demand, so contracts can read any chain\u2019s data in real time.\\n\\n4. **Programmable Solvers**\\n\\n- A solver network executes atomic cross-chain workflows (e.g., swap on Chain A, mint on Chain B) under a single transaction.\\n- Developers write simple solver scripts; the network handles routing and execution.\\n\\nTogether, these features turn Push Chain into a **shared-state L1** that enables universal apps to be native to all chains. A world where any user of any chain is able to access and interact with any app on any other chain.\\n\\n**Any Chain, Any App, Any User - One Push Chain**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What sets Push Chain apart from other Universal Chains?\\n\\nToday\u2019s so-called \u201cuniversal\u201d solutions still rely on bridges, wants double transactions or centralized relayers to move data and value. Push Chain is different\u2014it\u2019s the first **true** universal L1 that:\\n\\n- **Unifies users across chains**  \\n  Every blockchain address is natively supported. Wallets like MetaMask, Phantom, etc are all compatible with Push Chain. Gas is paid in any token on any chain.\\n\\n- **Acts as a universal execution layer**  \\n  All transactions finalize on the same chain, ensuring everyone interacts with the same app\u2014no hacks, no workarounds.\\n\\n- **Correctly attributes & executes any chain\u2019s transactions**  \\n  Transactions are signed, verified and attributed to the wallet on the source chain. A True universal chain supports all!\\n\\n- **Single Transaction for any chain**  \\n  Users sign just one transaction, regardless of their source chain.\\n\\n- **Requires just one deployment**  \\n  Deploy your EVM contract one time with no code changes and everything else just magically works.\\n\\nTogether, these innovations make Push Chain the only blockchain offering **true protocol-level interoperability**\u2014no bridges, no relayers, no fragmentation. Just one universal chain for all.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What does True Universal Chain mean?\\n\\nA **true universal chain** is a blockchain that treats every other network as first class citizens\u2014no bridges, no centralized relayers, and no compatibility hacks. It delivers:\\n\\n1. **Native Multichain Identity**  \\n   Wallets from Ethereum, Solana, any EVM or non-EVM chains all sign, verify and execute natively on Push Chain. So users never switch accounts or are troubled by the complexities of multiple wallets.\\n\\n2. **Unified Settlement**  \\n   Transactions from any network finalize on Push Chain, giving everyone a single source of truth and enabling same app to be accessible by users of all chains.\\n\\n3. **Single Transaction and Universal Fee Abstraction**  \\n   Users sign just one transaction, regardless of their source chain and pay gas in any token. No more maintaining or swapping countless tokens to use an app.\\n\\n4. **Deploy Once, Use Everywhere**  \\n   Developers write and deploy smart contracts once (EVM or otherwise) with **zero** extra code \u2014 one deployment covers all chains.\\n\\nPush Chain is the first to bake these features directly into its consensus and runtime, truly eliminating fragmentation \u2014 no workarounds, no extra layers, just one universal chain for everyone.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Token Related\\n\\n### Will there be a new token associated with Push Chain?\\n\\nAs a new layer 1, Push Chain would have its own native token with tokenomics suited to the functioning, maintenance, and security of a blockchain.\\n\\nFor full details, see our [Tokenomics deep dive](/knowledge/tokenomics/) \ud83d\udc40.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Doubts\\n\\n### What Happens to Push Notification and Push Chat?\\n\\nPush Chain is a natural evolution of Push Protocol\'s vision. Current services of Push Protocol remain a priority, ensuring they continue to improve while benefiting from the new infrastructure.\\n\\nToday\'s push notification and chat protocols will benefit significantly from being built on top of Push Chain. A dedicated section of the team will focus on maintaining and enhancing these protocols, ensuring they remain the de-facto standard in their respective domains.\\n\\nBy aligning with Push Chain, notifications and chat sent through the protocols will be processed as transactions on the chain. This integration not only enables these protocols to accrue value but also marks the beginning of a new chapter in their evolution, further enhancing their utility and impact within the web3 ecosystem.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Is this project a distraction from improving current services?\\n\\nNo, read \u261d\ufe0f [above](#what-happens-to-push-notification-and-push-chat).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Is Push Chain a shift away from Push Protocol\'s core focus on notifications and chat?\\n\\nNo. Push Chain builds upon Push Protocol\u2019s established foundation. Push Chain represents the **next evolution** of Push Protocol, not a departure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How will the launch of Push Chain affect existing partnerships and integrations?\\n\\nPush Chain complements existing partnerships by offering additional capabilities like cross-chain support, faster finality, and scalable solutions. It strengthens collaborations by enabling partners to build and scale universal applications.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How will Push Chain maintain decentralization while scaling?\\n\\nOur Devnet demonstrated how we\u2019ll scale using dynamic sharding and parallel execution\u2014boosting throughput without compromising decentralization.\\n\\nOn testnet, we focused on full stack interop with the chain running on [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft), a battle-tested, Byzantine-fault-tolerant engine. The network achieved sub-second finality and has the ability to handle up to [20k transactions per minute](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-chain/blob/main/docs/testnet-performance.md).\\n\\nThat proof of concept is just the beginning. As we roll out further scaling optimizations in later phases, we\u2019re confident Push Chain can meet the demands of universal applications\u2014securely and without centralization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Are there any risks of centralization with Push Chain?\\n\\n**No.** Push Chain\u2019s architecture emphasizes decentralization.\\n\\nPush Chain is fully decentralized and is designed to be robust and resilient. Anyone can run a node and participate in the network and is incentivized or penalized through PoS. To Summarize:\\n\\n- Validators and other actors operate independently and are incentivized through PoS.\\n- Governance mechanisms ensure community involvement.\\n- Every ecosystem party is included in governance to some extent.\\n\\nTo learn more about how to run a node, see our [Knowledge Base](/knowledge/) or check out our [Validator Node Repo](https://github.com/pushchain/push-chain-node).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## DAO and Grants\\n\\n### How will the current governance system change when the new token launches and when the migration is completed?\\n\\nThe Push DAO governance system will both evolve and expand as Push Chain launches. This is an expected process, since Push is becoming something more encompassing than the original Push Protocol. Delegates, ambassador programs, subDAOs, and everything else related to the DAO will be upgraded to reflect the key goals of achieving status as the hub for universal applications, run by all of the groups that make them possible.\\n\\n### How do I get involved with Push Chain Grants?\\n\\nPush Chain doesn\u2019t have a grants program yet but that will change soon!
