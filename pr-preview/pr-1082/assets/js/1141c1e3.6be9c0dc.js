Validators are required to deposit (stake) the networks native currency in adequate quantities to participate in the block creation.\\n\\n  Validators risk losing their staked assets _(getting slashed_ \\\\*) if they attempt to game the system for their personal gains by:\\n  - Approving fraudulent transactions\\n  - Censoring incoming transactions.\\n  - Failing to participate\\n  - Sending conflicting attestations\\n  - Proposing multiple blocks in a single slot (aka Equivocating)\\n\\n  As the network grows, the cost to attack it increases proportionally.\\n\\n- **Scalability** <br />\\n\\n  In PoS the block creation is a process of \u201c**probabilistic election**\u201d rather than \u201c**computation competition**\u201d.\\n\\n  Since time taken to elect a validator is significantly less, block creation frequency is (arguably) much higher than PoW networks, significantly boosting transaction speeds and scalability.\\n\\n- **Security and Resilience** <br />\\n\\n  As highlighted earlier, in a PoS network, the cost to attack increases proportionally with the network\u2019s growth.\\n\\n  A 51% attack\u2014where malicious actors gain control of 51% of staked coins to reverse transactions and manipulate block confirmations becomes increasingly impractical and expensive as the network grows and the token prices rises (ideally).\\n\\n  Dominic Williams, Founder of ICP, outlines three critical elements of Sybil resistance in his paper\\n\\n  [Sybil-resistant Network Identities From Dedicated Hardware](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eRTAe3szuIoZEloHvRMtZlrU7t2un4UVQ8LarpU3LNk/edit?tab=t.0)\\n  - **Entry Cost:** The expense required to participate.\\n  - **Existence Cost**: Ongoing costs to maintain participation.\\n  - **Exit Penalty**: The penalties for leaving or misbehaving\\n\\n  ![Fourth Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image4.webp)\\n\\n  PoW chains like Bitcoin does not have an Exit Penalty mechanism to punish the validators for deterring the integrity of network. But PoS chains, like Push Chain cover all the bases, ensuring stricter sybil resistance.\\n\\n## How does Proof of Stake work?\\n\\nThe Proof of Stake (PoS) process operates in four key phases:\\n\\n1. **Stake** - Become a validator\\n1. **Propose** - Validator Selection and Block Creation\\n1. **Vote** - Validation of the block\\n1. **Finalize** - Finalization of the block\\n\\n### Stake\\n\\nTo become a validator, you need to stake the network\u2019s native currency into a deposit contract. The staked amount must meet or exceed a predetermined threshold or lowerbound (e.g., 32 ETH for Ethereum).\\n\\nThis is important because the network is backed by the economic security of individual validators. If a validator misbehaves, they risk losing their staked assets and having skin in the game ensures that it is in the best interest of a validator to remain honest.\\n\\n### Propose\\n\\nOnce a number of validators have staked, the network will randomly select validators to propose a block. The randomly selected subset of validators or sometimes a single validator is responsible for proposing a block which has the transactions of the network that are ready to be processed.\\n\\n#### Validator Selection\\n\\n![Fifth Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image5.webp)\\n\\nValidator Selection forms the backbone of PoS, where nodes participate by staking the network\u2019s native currency into a deposit contract. The staked amount must meet or exceed a predetermined threshold or lowerbound (e.g., 32 ETH for Ethereum).\\n\\nTo propose a block, the probability of validators getting elected is directly proportional to the staked amount relative to the total coins staked across the network.\\n\\n#### Block creation\\n\\nTimekeeping is critical in PoS, structured through two key units: **Slot** and **Epoch.**\\n\\n- **Slot** - is a fixed duration of time that varies network to network (1 slot = 12 sec in Ethereum and 400ms in Solana).\\n- **Epoch**: A cycle comprising multiple slots (e.g., 32 slots in Ethereum)\\n\\nSlots are sequential and occur one after other in a linear manner.\\n\\n(_But not in case of Push Chain - More on this later_)\\n\\nEach slot is assigned to a randomly chosen validator, selected through specialized algorithms like RANDAO in Ethereum and VDF - Verifiable Delay Function in Solana.\\n\\nWithin their slot duration, validators are responsible for tasks:\\n\\n- Package transactions into a block\\n- Verify their validity\\n- Initiate the process of propagating the block across the network.\\n\\n![Sixth Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image6.webp)\\n\\n### Vote\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\nOnce a block is proposed, a committee of a defined number of validators is randomly chosen to vote on the validity of the block by careful examining of its contents - This process is called as attestation.\\n\\n**Attestation Weight**: Each vote is weighted based on the validator\u2019s stake.\\n\\n### Finalize\\n\\nA block is finalized when at least 2/3 of the total staked tokens sign off on its validity, ensuring a strong consensus.\\n\\n![Seventh Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image7.webp)\\n\\n### Edge cases\\n\\n- **Missed Blocks** - Instances when a validator fails to propose a block within their slot, it results in a missed block.\\n- **Orphaned Blocks** - These occur when a block is rejected by the validating committee or during a chain fork. Orphaned blocks represent alternative versions of chain history that are not followed by majority of network.\\n\\nIn summary, this is how the entire process would look like:\\n\\n![Eigth Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image8.webp)\\n\\n## Variants\\n\\nThere are a lot of variants of PoS, here are some of the most popular ones:\\n\\n| Variant        | Mechanism                                                                                     | Examples                    |\\n| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |\\n| Casper CBC/LMD | Ethereum\u2019s evolving model\u2014balances probabilistic confirmation with eventual finality.         | Ethereum 2.0 (Beacon Chain) |\\n| Tower BFT      | Solana\u2019s PoS with proof-of-history timekeeping and weighted voting rounds.                    | Solana                      |\\n| Tendermint PoS | Two-phase commit (prevote/precommit) with instant finality once \u2265 \u2154 of stake signs.           | Cosmos, Binance Chain       |\\n| Nominated PoS  | Token holders nominate (delegate) validators; nominators share in slashes/rewards.            | Polkadot, Kusama            |\\n| Delegated PoS  | A small elected committee of validators chosen by stakeholder votes; the rest are non-voting. | EOS, TRON                   |\\n| Pure PoS       | Validator set rotates randomly each block with minimal additional structure.                  | Algorand                    |\\n| Avalanche PoS  | Repeated random subsampling (gossip-based) polls across validators for rapid consensus.       | Avalanche                   |\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this article, we have covered the basics of Proof of Stake and how it works."}}')}}]);
