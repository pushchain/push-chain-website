As such, Sturdy will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the status of their loans and high-yielding opportunities on the platform.\\n\\n### Bringing Interest-Free Lending to DeFi\\n\\nDeFi\u2019s lending and borrowing protocols played a pivotal role in the industry\u2019s rise, bringing millions into the decentralized realm. However, in the present scenario, borrowers are required to pay heavy interests for their loans along with over-collateralizing for the same. In this regard, Sturdy is the one of the kind of DeFi protocol that facilitates interest free borrowing for users.\\n\\nThe protocol utilizes the borrowers\u2019 collateralized assets in a smart way by staking them with protocols like Yearn, Convex, and Lido. Then, the interest generated by these assets is used to pay interest to the lenders. This means that while borrowers can take advantage of interest-free loans, lenders can still make high yields and profits by lending on Sturdy.\\n\\nWith a truly novel approach to lending and borrowing, Sturdy is poised to bring in a new wave of users into DeFi. As such, the protocol can benefit from a decentralized communication channel that allows seamless interaction with its users. This is where the collaboration with EPNS comes into play.\\n\\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThe collaboration between EPNS and Sturdy aims to create a direct communication channel between the users and the protocol for seamless interaction. This channel is housed on the EPNS platform where users of Sturdy can easily subscribe to it. Subscribers will receive decentralized push notifications from the platform whenever\\n\\n- Their loans approach liquidation\\n- There are high APY opportunities available on the platform\\n  This allows users to take prompt action and grab the opportunities on time. Moreover, these notifications also save users from the hassle of manually checking for all these updates and improves the user experience on the platform along with the participation rates. EPNS has a chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application to ensure users never miss out on these notifications.\\n\\nWe at EPNS are excited to dive into this alliance with Sturdy and hope to contribute to the growth of the platform.\\n\\n### About Sturdy\\n\\nSturdy is a first of its kind of DeFi lending protocol offering interest-free borrowing and high yield lending. Users can interact with the protocol in two ways: as \u2018borrowers\u2019 who take out loans and provide collateral or as \u2018lenders\u2019 who earn yield on their assets.\\n\\nBorrowers pay no interest, withdrawal fees, or deposit fees. Instead, their collateral is staked, and the yield from their staked collateral is used to provide interest to lenders. Lenders benefit from interest rates that are higher and more consistent than a money market where borrowers pay a variable APY.\\n\\nTo ensure that you don\u2019t miss out on the latest developments, stay connected with Sturdy on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SturdyFinance), [Medium](https://sturdyfinance.medium.com/), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/tRVHp6Vx5N)."}}')}}]);
