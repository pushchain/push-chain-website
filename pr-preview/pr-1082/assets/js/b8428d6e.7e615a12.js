His advice and guidance have been pivotal to EPNS\u2019s growth and strategy. We look forward to his greater involvement with EPNS and helping us become the de-facto communication layer of Ethereum.\\n\\nSandeep has always been at the forefront of pushing the boundaries of Web3 technology and making the Ethereum ecosystem much more user-friendly. As we build the next-generation of Web3.0 communication infrastructure \u2014 via a decentralized middleware blockchain agnostic notifications protocol \u2014 we look forward to gaining insight from Sandeep from his experience in building Polygon, and interacting with different dApps and protocols as he built the rich dApp ecosystem of Polygon, as it stands today.\\n\\nWhen asked about Sandeep\u2019s thoughts about joining EPNS as Advisor, Sandeep said,\\n\\n> The lack of notifications and communication of key information to users of Web3 protocols and services has been one of the greatest user experience barriers in Web3. Even as Polygon looks to build a more robust and scalable decentralized network infrastructure, without a decentralized communication layer on top of it, users will find it hard to use Web3 tools and services in the long run. I\u2019m glad EPNS is solving one of the major infrastructure gaps in the Web3 ecosystem. I\u2019m excited to be a part of this journey and to see Harsh and Richa pull this amazing feat off.\\n\\nWe cannot wait to work with Sandeep and bring you the future of push notifications. Thank you Sandeep for joining us, and welcome to the EPNS Family."}}')}}]);
