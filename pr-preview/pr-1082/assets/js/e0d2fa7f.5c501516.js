It is a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain\\nbuilt to allow developers to create universal apps and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s, and L3s enabling transactions from any chain - any app and any user.\\n\\n[Explore more about Push Chain here](https://push.org)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc65 How does this benefit zkPass and Push Chain users?\\n\\n**Verify your private data on any app and any chain.**\\n\\nPush Chain extends zkPass\u2019s proving capabilities by enabling verification support for any EVM as well as non-EVM chains like Solana, Aptos etc.\\n\\n**Universal private identity**\\n\\nUsers can now create a truly private and unified blockchain presence through Push ID - a universal identity system that seamlessly connects all their wallets (EVM and non-EVM) into one profile.\\n\\nThis unified identity gains enhanced privacy through zkPass, enabling **users to prove wallet ownership, assets or any other private information across any blockchain** without revealing their actual wallet details and enabling selective disclosure of wallets while linking to any application. **One private KYC that can be instantly validated on all apps and all chains.**\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc77\u200d\u2642\ufe0fHow does it benefit builders?\\n\\n**Build Universally accessible privacy-centric DApps**\\nPush Chain enables developers to build applications that work across any blockchain, while zkPass adds powerful privacy-preservation capabilities to this universal reach. Developers can use the [Push Chain](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-chain-sdk) and [Transgate](https://zkpass.gitbook.io/zkpass/developer-guides/extension-js-sdk) SDKs to create apps that verify user credentials, assets, or achievements across chains without managing complex privacy infrastructure or dealing with multiple chain-specific identity systems.\\n\\n**Build privately - verifiable DeFi Protocols**\\n\\nBuild more sophisticated DeFi applications that can access verified user credentials while respecting privacy.\\n\\nThrough Push Chain\'s shared state and zkPass\'s verification system, protocols can validate credit scores, collateral, and transaction history across chains without exposing sensitive user data enabling better risk assessment and more efficient capital allocation while maintaining user privacy.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd13\xa0What usecases does the collab unlock?\\n\\nIn addition to the unified KYC and universal privacy-focused DeFi applications discussed above, the collaboration between Push Chain and zkPass unlocks the following use cases:\\n\\n**Universal Private RWA Hub**\\nRWA marketplaces like [Kanza Finance](https://canza.io/) can leverage Push Chain and zkPass to enable instant cross-chain RWA operations with built-in compliance verification, all while keeping sensitive user data private and secure.\\n\\n**Unified AI marketplaces**\\n\\nAI & Privacy centric chains like [Polyhedra EXP](https://www.polyhedra.network/) can host AI data marketplaces for using zkPass, users can privately contribute data to AI models while: Proving data authenticity without exposure and receiving rewards tied to any chain.\\n\\nUsers can optimise their on-chain data collection process by using Push Chain\u2019s unified shared settlement layer.\\n\\n**Universal launchpads.**\\n\\nCross chain launchpads like [Pools Finance](https://www.poolz.finance/) can leverage Push Chain and zkPass to power - universal DApp launchpads where Developers can utilize Push Chain\u2019s Universal Shared State and Parallel txn processing to deploy dApps once and instantly reach users across all or any specified networks while maintaining privacy preservation, credential verification and compliance through zkPass.\\n\\n## **\ud83c\udf0c**\xa0What does this mean for Web3?\\n\\n**Unifying experiences by bringing users together.**\\n\\nPush Chain isn\u2019t here to replace networks or compete with any; instead, it aims to eliminate the fragmented state of Web3 by unifying settlement across all chains under one universal shared state, unlocking a seamless, interconnected Web3 experience.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n1. Follow [@PushChain](https://x.com/PushChain) on X to get the latest updates about Push Chain\\n2. Check out the\xa0[Push Chain Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.push.org/)\xa0for a detailed overview of the vision and the underlying technicalities.\\n3. Visit the\xa0[Push Chain Website](https://push.org/chain)\xa0to find a one-pager explanation of the vision.\\n4. [Push Chain Devnet](https://scan.push.org/)\xa0is running live on Proof-of-Stake network validators, storage and archival nodes. The network already supports consumer transactions as well.\\n5. [Push Chain Simulate Tx](https://simulate.push.org/)\xa0already provides a way for everyone to send tx from any chain using wallet abstraction.\\n6.
