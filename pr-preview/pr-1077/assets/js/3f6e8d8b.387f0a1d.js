Here\u2019s what we achieved in Phase 0:\\n\\n### Metagovernance\\n\\n- Implemented 4 roles with different capabilities to allow community members to participate in Push governance in a variety of ways. DAO members can vote directly in governance proposals or delegate their voting power to a delegate that represents their ideals.\\n- Learning from best practices from other successful DAOs, we created an efficient mechanism to enable faster implementation and execution of important proposals that got immediate traction within the community.\\n- Implemented PIPs (Push Improvement Proposals) to enable Push Protocol to work together with the community to form standardized, community-driven improvements, specs, and standards.\\n- PGIP (Push Governance Improvement Proposals) and rewards: intended to open the floor for contributors with suggestions to improve the Governance process. These come attached with rewards upon the successful ratification and implementation of proposals.\\n\\n### Push Grants Program\\n\\n- After the successful first Grants Program, we took the feedback from the grantees and the community and launched the Push Grants Program v2.0.\\n- PGPv2.0 enhances the companionship offered to projects and emphasizes a collaboration in which Projects grow hand by hand with Push \u2014 including guidance, mentorship, technical support, partnership intros, and more.\\n- As of April 2023, the [Push Grants Ecosystem](https://twitter.com/Push_DAO/status/1638221385288785926) is made of 27 projects. More applications are already in queue to be reviewed by the Push Grants Review Committee.\\n\\n### Other Supporting Initiatives\\n\\n- <b>Rockstars of Push:</b> With the success of the original Rockstars of EPNS campaign, we extended the program one more season with Rockstars of Push vol2. The program is almost half way through and more and more we receive submissions from hackers, media content producers, and Push community members in general.\\n- <b>Push Bug Bounty Program:</b> Approved via governance to allow community members and security researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities in our systems\\n\\n## Enter Push DAO Phase 1\\n\\nIn the next phase of the Push DAO, we\u2019ll focus on setting the foundation to achieve sufficient decentralization (community ownership). By building the Push DAO in a modular fashion over time, we intend to empower our community to work on initiatives that further the goals of the organization.\\n\\n<b>Push DAO phase 1 highlights:</b>\\n\\n- Official Start Date: April 3rd, 2023\\n- Push Ambassadors Program v1.0\\n- Community-Managed Push Grants Program\\n- Open the floor for Push Contributors\\n- DAO infrastructure\\n\\n### Push Ambassadors Program v1.0\\n\\nThe Push Ambassadors Program kicked-off phase 1 of the Push Decentralization Roadmap on April 3rd, 2023.\\n\\n- Initial focus on LATAM and Spanish-speaking communities\\n- Marketing objective: Brand awareness. With content production in various platforms and formats.\\n- Create a replicable Ambassadors Program that can be installed in other communities.\\n\\nThis program will run in the paid contributor modality, where the ambassadors will be the first official community contributors to the Push DAO. This comes together with contributor reputation and other important DAO activities that need to happen to build an effective, efficient, and decentralized DAO.\\n\\n### Community-managed Push Grants Program\\n\\nLessons learned during this second iteration of the Push Grants Program will be implemented for future editions to improve even more the program and maximize the benefit for the grantees. The process is now being fine-tuned to have minimal social coordination cost and enable the program to be managed by a <b>Grants Workstream</b>.\\n\\nMore details will be shared as we advance towards completing this goal!\\n\\n### Open the floor for Push Contributors\\n\\nThis will be an ongoing process that will happen slowly through the rest of the year in a controlled fashion, where the team will work closely with the contributors.\\n\\nSlowly giving control of the work streams to the community, and more important making sure all governance infrastructure and procedures are in place to empower the community and each work stream to operate, grow, and take decisions.\\n\\nThis will include the gradual influence of the Push DAO over earmarked PUSH allocation. The funds set aside for the Push DAO will eventually be entirely controlled by the DAO, and allocated towards initiatives voted on and approved through on-chain governance. This could include event sponsorships, developer grants, marketing initiatives, and more. The Community Fund, which currently sits with the Push Protocol entity, can choose to fund the Push DAO fund with more PUSH as requested from the DAO.\\n\\n<center> <b>.   .   .</b></center>\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\nThe focus of Governance Phase 1 is to lay the foundation that will help accelerate our 2024 plan of becoming a 100% community owned project.\\n\\nAs we continue making progress, we are looking to engage in more DAO-to-DAO collaboration opportunities, and make more work streams available for the DAO (moderation, governance, engineering, and more).\\n\\nThis will help us to realize our Push DAO vision of creating the necessary frameworks and tools to enable all forms of communication for everyone in web3 at a protocol level in a permissionless and seamless way.\\n\\nAs well as our Push DAO mission of revolutionizing the web3 UX by ensuring wallets, protocols and all web3 services are able to communicate via notifications, chats, video calls or more via a open and secure network.\\n\\nWe are excited about all the opportunities ahead and we are happy to continue BUIDLing and PUSHing together."}}')}}]);
