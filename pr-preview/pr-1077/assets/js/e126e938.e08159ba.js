As such, DeFi enthusiasts can now receive their daily dose of DeFi updates directly on their devices as decentralized push notifications.\\n\\nDeFi\u2019s monumental success is often attributed to the rapid innovations, tech developments, and high return investment opportunities that emerged from this space. But behind the scenes, DeFi\u2019s dedicated news and media outlets played an important role in DeFi\u2019s rise. By taking day-to-day updates to the masses, media companies spread education and awareness about this emerging industry ultimately setting the revolution in motion.\\n\\nOne such media outlet is The Defiant.\\n\\n# Pragmatic Journalism; Objective Information\\n\\nThe Defiant is a DeFi-centric news and media platform that curates, digests, and analyzes all the significant developments in the industry to keep readers updated at all times. It acts as a one-stop-shop for all DeFi enthusiasts to learn, research, and stay informed about the various trends in this space while closely following the growth of the industry.\\n\\nThe Defiant delivers data-backed and objective pieces of information to its readers while actively working to eliminate misinformation. However, for a platform that is primarily focused on DeFi, The Defiant lacks a decentralized communication system to take this information directly to its readers. And through this strategic collaboration, we at EPNS aim to build this system.\\n\\n\u201cThe Defiant is a platform that we at EPNS rely on to get major industry updates. The pragmatic journalism and research-backed information published on the platform helps us assess the vibe of the industry and ultimately build products that users would love to use. In this regard, we\u2019re enthralled with this collaboration with The Defiant and we hope that decentralized notifications become an integral part of its operations,\u201d says the team at EPNS, speaking about the collaboration.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThe collaboration between EPNS and The Defiant has one goal and that is to build a decentralized communication channel for the platform. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform and regular readers of The Defiant can subscribe to it. When they do so, they receive updates directly to their wallets whenever new DeFi news articles are published on the platform. This eliminates the need for centralized communication services and pushed forward the DeFi revolution.\\n\\n\u201cEPNS is a very important innovation in DeFi,\u201d says the team at The Defiant. \u201cThe need for a decentralized communication system will be key and EPNS is one of the few teams building this primitive. EPNS is helping communication within the decentralized world become more efficient and transparent, and we believe our readers are poised to benefit from this system of direct communication.\u201d\\n\\nAs The Defiant continues to spread awareness about DeFi to all corners of the world, we are pleased to collaborate with them on this journey and hope to continue this alliance into the future.\\n\\n# About The Defiant\\n\\nThe Defiant curates, digests, and analyzes all the major developments in decentralized finance, so that you can stay informed and smart about the most cutting-edge and fastest-changing corner of crypto and finance. We\u2019re delivering journalism with authority; objective, data-backed, primary-source, reported pieces, written by insiders who can also provide informed analysis on the latest moves.\\n\\nContact: [Website](https://thedefiant.io/)"}}')}}]);
