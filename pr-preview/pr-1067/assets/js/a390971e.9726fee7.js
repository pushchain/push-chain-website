It\'s about leveraging Push Notifications for important alerts and/or using our all-new [Notification Settings](https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings/) to customize notifications. We also want to highlight the potential integration of conditional gating (messaging that can only be accessible by holding a specific NFT, token, or activity history).\\n\\nHere are a few ideas\\n\\n- <b>SocialImpactHub</b>: A DApp dedicated to social activists, where users can receive notifications about upcoming rallies or events.\\n- <b>EcoAlert</b>: An environmental initiative platform where users can chat about sustainable practices\\n- <b>CommunityCare</b>: A local community DApp where neighbors can communicate in real time, set up events, and receive notifications about local emergencies or activities.\\n- <b>PushForChange</b>: A fundraising platform that sends out notifications about new charitable campaigns. Users can chat with charity organizers and use conditional gating to access exclusive fundraising events based on their donation history.\\n\\n\\"Merhaba Push Protocol\\" seeks to acknowledge the innovative spirit of developers who merge social initiatives with technology, making a meaningful impact in the world using Push Protocol.\\n\\n#### 2. üèÜ Turkish Ice Cream - Creative Bounty ‚∏∫ $2,000\\n\\nJust as getting a Turkish ice cream can bring a few surprises, with this bounty we‚Äôre looking for the most ingenious solutions built using the Push Protocol. Challenge the norms and serve up your most creative implementations.\\n\\nSimply build with Push Notifications, Chat, or Video in any capacity. Best and most creative use case all around wins.\\n\\n#### 3. üèÜ Push Chat Conditional Gating Integration for DApps ‚∏∫ $1,500\\n\\nShowcase the potential of Push by integrating its Conditional Gating feature into your dApps. This feature allows you to create dynamic and sophisticated permissions for your user community by setting unique conditions for joining or communicating in specific group chats.\\n\\nYour task? Integrate the Push Chat conditional gating feature in your dApp, utilizing at least two of the following use cases:\\n\\n- Token-gated group\\n- NFT-gated group\\n- Multi-chain conditions\\n- Sending message conditions\\n- Non-web3 conditions using Guild\\n- Game theories by combining multiple conditions\\n- Ensure smooth UX/UI and seamless user verification based on the set rules\\n\\nFor more information regarding Conditional Gating and Rules for Group Chats, checkout our documentation here üëâhttps://comms.push.org/docs/chat/build/conditional-rules-for-group/\\n\\n#### 4. üèÜ Cappadocia Hot Air Balloon ‚∏∫ $5,000\\n\\nThis is a Pool Bounty prize which will be given to top 10 implementations, priority will be given to those who integrate the following Push Notification/Chat features:\\n\\n- [Channel settings](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/build/create-channel-settings/)\\n- [Conditional gating](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/build/conditional-rules-for-group/)\\n- [Stream notifications](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/build/stream-notifications/)\\n\\n### Everything You Need ‚Äì Covered in the Push Workshop üõ†Ô∏è\\n\\nWe\'re hosting a workshop at ETH Global Istanbul open to all developers to learn how to build using Push‚Äôs communication tools titled: How to build native Web3 Messaging & Notifications Apps with Push Protocol.\\n\\nüìÖFriday, November 17 ‚Äì 3:40pm <br/>\\nüó∫Ô∏èWorkshop Room 1\\n\\nThis will be a great chance for you to see a live demo of how to build with Push tools and also a great chance to meet our devs and ask for advice on your project.\\n\\nWith that, we look forward to meeting all of you and can‚Äôt wait to see what you build.
