We achieved some significant milestones that we‚Äôre excited to share with you.\\n\\nWe sent out over 4 million notifications and reached 174,000 subscribers. But our journey doesn‚Äôt stop here. Let‚Äôs dive into the exciting updates for March from the Push Ecosystem:\\n\\n### Partnership Updates\\n\\nWe‚Äôve seen a surge in clients integrating our notifications and messaging services. Some of our notable partners include [Verso Wallet](https://get-verso.com/), [DEXYNTH](https://www.dexynth.com/), [Outposts](https://outposts.io/), [Bitget](https://twitter.com/bitgetglobal), [AlphaX](https://alphax.finance/), [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.foundation/), [RoseonX](https://roseon.world/), and many more. They‚Äôve all integrated Push notifications and chat into their platforms.\\n\\nIn addition, we partnered with the [LearnWeb3IO](https://learnweb3.io/) hackathon to support future builders.\\n\\n### Product Enhancements\\n\\nWe introduced the Push [MetaMask Snooze Snap](https://app.push.org/?/snap), which allows users to snooze notifications for up to 72 hours. This feature helps users manage their notifications at their own pace.We introduced a \'guest\' mode on our dApp, making it easier than ever to explore Push without connecting your wallet\\n\\nWe also benchmarked our [Push Chat Architecture](https://push.org/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message/) to make Push Chat work more efficiently. We launched the [Price Tracker Channel](https://www.notion.so/Push-x-Berachain-Spaces-Creative-Changes-5756710613b74055baa39ba4d534fe33?pvs=21) to help users get notified directly when their chosen cryptocurrency hits their desired price target.\\n\\n### Community Engagement\\n\\nWe‚Äôve been actively engaging with our vibrant community through various initiatives. We hosted a demo session for Push Nodes and awarded Push Alpha access NFT to over 700 users.\\n\\nOur ‚ÄúDecentralize with Push Campaign‚Äù led to the acquisition of more than 4,200 new users. We also unveiled [Tokenomics V2](https://push.org/blog/push-tokenomics-v2-engine/) for the $PUSH token.\\n\\nTo celebrate the listing of the $PUSH token on the Bitget Global exchange, we ran a quest campaign. We also announced the ultra-rare role ‚ÄúPush Chad‚Äù for our community.\\n\\n### Ecosystem Highlights\\n\\nIn March, we featured ETH Gas Price Tracker, [CryptoJobsList](https://cryptojobslist.com/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), and [Bankless](https://www.bankless.com/) as the Push Channel of the Week.\\n\\n### DAO\\n\\nWe launched the Push Grants V3 initiative to support builders in the Push Ecosystem. We also welcomed [Ian](https://twitter.com/ExpatCrypto3) as our new DAO Relations Lead and [Carla](https://twitter.com/carlaupgrade) as our Community DAO Relations role for push_dao.\\n\\nWe‚Äôre excited about the progress we‚Äôve made and look forward to what the future holds for the Push Ecosystem. Stay tuned for more updates!"}}');
