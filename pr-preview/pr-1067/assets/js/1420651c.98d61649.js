As such, users of NFT TiX are poised to receive decentralized push notifications about various upcoming events like concerts, film screenings, and festivals. These notifications will allow users to get timely access to the tickets and grab the chance of attending their favorite event.\\n\\n### NFT-TiX: Reimagine Event Tickets as NFTs\\n\\nNFT TiX is a decentralized marketplace that aims to bridge the gap between ticket buyers and ticket sellers in today’s world. From sporting events to film screenings and music concerts and art exhibitions, all events operate on a ticketing basis. This means that people interested in these events buy tickets to attend them. However, today’s ticketing system is not as straightforward as it seems.\\n\\nThere is heavy involvement of third-party ticket sellers who make the most profits and take a significant share out of the sellers’ pockets. Ticket buyers, on the other hand, end up paying more than what is required. Moreover, regular tickets come with the threat of being stolen, forged, or lost, and buyers end up missing out on their favorite events.\\n\\nThis is the gap that NFT TiX aims to bridge. By tokenizing tickets as NFTs, NFT TiX evades the need for third-party involvement and also ensures that the ticket truly belongs to its buyer. Apart from this, the ticket goes from being a liability to an asset that can be traded and sold anytime after the event. Special perks and incentives can also be etched into NFTs for the buyers. Industry experts believe that NFTs and the future of ticketing and NFT TiX is already taking strides in that direction.\\n\\nAs such, the platform needs a communication medium that keeps users updated about all the upcoming events, and EPNS aims to achieve that.\\n\\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our partnership with NFT TiX, we aim to create a decentralized communication channel that allows the platform to directly interact with its users. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform and users of NFT-TiX can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. The notifications will be sent out whenever there is a new upcoming event of interest so that users can grab the various opportunities and attend their favorite events.\\n\\nEPNS has a Chrome extension, a DAPP, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\\n\\nWe’re pleased to team up with NFT TiX on their journey towards reimagine tickets as NFTs and hope to continue the alliance into the future.\\n\\n### About NFT-TiX\\n\\nNFT TiX a is a ticketing platform and marketplace built on Ethereum blockchain. It is run and governed by smart contracts, empowering ticket sellers to connect with ticket buyers one-on-one. This is a piece of revolutionary technology that helps the ticketing industry step away from middlemen once and for all. NFT TiX prioritizes fair prices, profit for sellers on the secondary market, and exclusive perks for ticket holders from event organizers.\\n\\nStay in touch!
