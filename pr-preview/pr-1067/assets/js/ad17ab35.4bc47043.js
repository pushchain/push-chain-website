This means the largest web3 communication platform is now available to BNB‚Äôs ecosystem of thousands of dapps and hundreds of thousands of daily users.\\n\\nBack in September 2022, Push launched on Polygon‚Äôs mainnet, signaling our first step into becoming <i>the</i> multi-chain communication protocol for all of web3. Staying true to our commitment of an interoperable future, the next chain to support Push Protocol is BNB Chain.\\n\\nThe launch of Push Protocol on BNB Chain will enable <i>Push Notifications</i> and <i>Push Chat</i>. Read on to learn more.\\n\\n### Push Notifications on BNB Chain\\n\\nTo date, Push Protocol has powered over 25 million notifications to +70,000 subscribers across the Ethereum and Polygon networks. The BNB Chain launch will allow existing BNB dapps and developers to launch and create their own channels and offer customized notifications in response to on- and off-chain events.\\n\\nAny application or individual can launch a notification channel starting today. At launch, 1inch, Sushi, Thena, and Apeswap channels will be live for mainnet notifications.\\n\\nBNB Chain will be implementing Push Smart Contracts v1.5, the newest upgrade to the Push Protocol. Push v1.5 upgrades provide imperative features including <i>channel creation with PUSH token, enabling notifications using Subgraph, inclusion of EIP-1271, etc.</i> Additionally, it also enables extra customization, including time-bound channels and editable channel details. The Protocol Fee Pool in v1.5 will deduct 10 PUSH from the original staked amount (minimum 50 PUSH to create a channel) for any critical transaction (like creation, reactivation, or detail modification). As part of the upcoming v2 release, the Protocol Fee Pool will have more functionality ‚Äî including allowing protocol users to claim rewards and distributing funds to wallets that integrate Push Protocol. [Learn more about Push v1.5!](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-push-protocol-v1-5-80eb39b55424)\\n\\nAll of these features will be enabled for BNB Chain notifications starting today. The BNB notification ecosystem will be available through the primary Push Protocol app: [app.push.org](http://app.push.org/). In order to create and enable your channel for the BNB Chain, you can follow [this guide](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/tutorials/create-your-channel/) to ensure the complete setup is done adequately.\\n\\n### Push Chat on BNB Chain\\n\\nIn October, Push Protocol announced our alpha for Push Chat ‚Äî p2p web3 native chat between on-chain addresses. Push Chat is enabled for Ethereum and Polygon addresses, and with the BNB Chain launch, whitelisted addresses can now chat through BNB Chain as well. We‚Äôll have more information about the continued rollout of Push Chat, so stay tuned on the [Push Protocol Twitter.](https://x.com/PushChain)\\n\\n### Existing Push Ethereum & Polygon Users\\n\\nTo existing Push Protocol users on Ethereum and Polygon ‚Äî say hello to the BNB Chain communities! And get ready for more mainnet announcements down the road. With today‚Äôs BNB announcement, no action is needed by Ethereum and Polygon users. All notifications and channels will remain functional, as will PUSH staking and rewards.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBack in September with the Push Protocol rebrand, we made a promise to build out the multi-chain communication protocol for all of web3. With the Polygon and Push Chat launches, we started our journey. With today‚Äôs BNB Chain launch, we‚Äôre continuing that promise to the Push community and to web3 at large.\\n\\nLet‚Äôs #PUSH for web3 communication!\\n\\n#PoweredbyPush"}}');
