We gave away sponsorships of <b>$5,000</b> and gave away <b>eight</b> prizes!\\n\\nHere‚Äôs a glimpse of some of the exceptional teams that built with us at [ETHAmsterdam](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1518558686498594816), [HackMoney 2022](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1530157366229860353), and [ETHNewYork](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1541466249825091584).\\n\\nAnd here, we are, working with ETHGlobal again for the [ETHOnline 2022](https://online.ethglobal.com/) hackathon to encourage all types of builders, hackers, and creators to participate and build the future of web3 communication with EPNS.\\n\\nSo let us give you guys a quick breakdown to help you BUIDL at the ETHOnline 2022 Hackathon!\\n\\n### üîî About Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)\\n\\nIf you are unfamiliar with what we do, [EPNS](https://epns.io/) is a decentralized communication protocol for web3. Any dapps, smart contracts, backends, or protocols can send comm (starting with on-chain / off-chain / gasless notifications) tied to the user wallet in an open, gasless, multichain, and platform agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet or front end to tap into the network and get the comm across.\\n\\n### üîó Important Reference links for Developers\\n\\n- [ETHOnline 2022 ‚Äî Checklist](https://www.notion.so/epns/ETHOnline-Hackathon-Doc-List-cd9d0fc69f0d4e4691c60c772b03d48a) <br />\\n  If you are new to EPNS, don‚Äôt worry!

We‚Äôre offering:\\n\\n- Grand Prize ‚Äî $4,000\\n- 2nd Prize ‚Äî $2,500\\n- 3rd Prize ‚Äî $ 1,500\\n- Runner Ups x 5 ‚Äî $400\\n\\nAlso, we have <b>1 million PUSH grants</b> for all the builders ‚Äî apply for grants on [gov.epns.io](https://gov.epns.io/) to keep building the next wave of innovation.\\n\\n## üé´ What‚Äôs Next and Important Dates and Times\\n\\n1.
