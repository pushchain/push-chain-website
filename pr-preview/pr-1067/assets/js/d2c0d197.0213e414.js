As such, users of the platform are poised to receive updates about everything Flipside Crypto right on their devices.\\n\\nBlockchain technology, as a pivotal part of the next industrial revolution, has been growing from strength to strength in the last decade. Today, this technology is the cornerstone for the crypto, decentralized finance, web3, and NFT-metaverse industries. And just like the internet, user interactions within the blockchain space create a large amount of user data. This data is an invaluable resource to understand consumer behavior within the industry to create user-centric blockchain applications going forward.\\n\\nHowever, in its current state, the blockchain industry lacks a reliable analytics and query protocol that developers can source their data from. Enter Flipside Crypto. This novel blockchain protocol has been making major strides in the crypto-analytics realm with community-driven, incentivized insights.\\n\\n# On-Demand Analytics Through Structured Bounty Programs\\n\\nFlipside Crypto is a community-driven crypto analytics platform that allows users to create and share data-backed insights for the projects that interest them. In doing so, the platform provides rich pre-modeled blockchain data that anyone can use to build futuristic applications for this emerging industry. On Flipside Crypto, developers can raise queries for the analytics and data they require about a platform and regular users of that platform can answer these queries with their unique insights.\\n\\nThese on-demand insights are incentivized through the platform\u2019s structured bounty programs based on feedback from the protocol in question and community members. This means that users who take time to learn about their favorite blockchain protocols can get paid to do so and eventually level up to become \u201cSQL Superstars\u201d.\\n\\nFlipside Crypto has already partnered with blockchain networks and protocols like Solana, ThorChain, and ParaSwap, among others to make their on-chain data easily available for use.\\n\\nNow, given the community-driven nature of the platform, it is vital for Flipside Crypto to have a robust communication mechanism through which it can constantly keep its users in the loop. And this is where the collaboration with EPNS comes into play.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail?\\n\\nThe collaboration aims to create an official medium of communication between the users and Flipside Crypto to help them communicate on important aspects of the protocol. Flipside Crypto will soon have an official channel on the EPNS platform that can be subscribed to. Users who subscribe to the channel will receive direct notifications from Flipside Crypto about any platform update, as and when it occurs.\\n\\nEPNS has a mobile application, decentralized application, and a chrome extension to ensure that users do not miss out on these notifications no matter what device they\u2019re on.\\n\\nAs Flipside continues to facilitate the growth of the blockchain space through rich data-driven insights on consumer behavior, we\u2019re pleased to collaborate with them on this journey and hope to become an integral part of their operations.\\n\\n# **About Flipside Crypto**\\n\\nFlipside provides Community Enabled Crypto Analytics, allowing our users to create and share data insights on the crypto projects they care most about. Through dashboard and visualization tools, as well as auto-generated API endpoints, data analysts can easily create queries that answer any question.\\n\\nStay in touch! | [Website](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/) | [Blog](https://blog.flipsidecrypto.com/) |"}}')}}]);
