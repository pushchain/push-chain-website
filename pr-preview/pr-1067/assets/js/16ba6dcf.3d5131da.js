Using the protocol, any dApp, smart contract or service can send notifications to users(wallet addresses) in a platform agnostic fashion (mobile, web, or user wallets). The DeFi aspect of the protocol also ensures that the user receives and earns from those notifications.\\n\\nStay in touch with Push!
