While some offer the utmost decentralization, others are carved out for scalability, and then some are exclusively meant to support NFTs. The <b>growing number of blockchains</b> and their categorization isnâ€™t particularly a bad thing.\\n\\nHowever, blockchains, by design, cannot communicate with or read data from sources outside their own ecosystem. This results in many high-potential but segregated blockchain ecosystems, each having its own isolated set of applications, platforms, and users.\\n\\nAs a solution, we have projects working to address the lack of interoperability to help apps and users transfer data and value across different chains. One project that is leading the charge in interoperability is Socket. And we are thrilled to announce that EPNS is partnering with this innovative project to bring a decentralized push notification service to its users.\\n\\n## Where Does EPNS Fit Into Socketâ€™s Equation?\\n\\nSocket enables blockchain interoperability through its two key components:\\n\\n1. The Socket Liquidity Layer acts as a DEX aggregator and ensures users can easily transfer funds across blockchains as per their speed, fee, and security preferences.\\n\\n2. Socket Data Layer is a messaging layer that smart contracts and, thus, dapps hosted across blockchains can seamlessly interact and share data with each other.\\n\\nWith these two components, Socket offers developers the base infrastructure to build dapps that can operate across multiple chains. This also translates to the fact that users of the dapps using Socketâ€™s infra would be able to easily transfer value across chains. And this is where EPNS comes into the picture.\\n\\n<b>Socket will use EPNS to notify its dapp users whenever bridging between two chains is complete</b>. Further, users will have the option to get notified whenever the gas fees drop so they can execute their cross-chain transactions for the lowest possible fee.\\n\\nIt is a delight for us to be partnering with projects like Socket that are genuinely pushing the bars higher for interoperability standards. While we have kicked off this collaboration with two use cases, we are excited to explore more use cases as the platform develops and new possibilities come into the picture.\\n\\nStay tuned to keep updated on the most recent EPNS partnerships and developments around the decentralized push notification standards!\\n\\n### About Socket\\n\\n[Socket](https://socket.tech/) is an interoperability protocol for secure & efficient data and asset transfers across chains. Socket is not a bridge or a cross-chain app â€” it is an infrastructure that allows developers to build these things easily. Developers can use Socket to build apps with interoperability as a core part of app infrastructure.\\n\\n[Website](http://socket.tech/) | [Bungee](http://bungee.exchange/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SocketDotTech) | [Discord](https://t.co/Il4enrA7Lo)"}}');
