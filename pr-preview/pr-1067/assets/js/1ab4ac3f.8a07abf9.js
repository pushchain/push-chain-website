Preparing backend tooling for monitoring, working on the PUSH Nodes, improvements to our dApp & SDKs, and of course one of out most awaited features \u2014 Wallet to Wallet communication.\\n\\n- The <b>Analytics Dashboard</b> have been in development to provide services with insights about notifications and their channels. The entire backend Integration is done, and the Dashboard will be released very soon.\\n- With <b>PUSH Nodes</b> being a central piece in the EPNS ecosystem, optimization together with the standardization of payloads plays a critical role to ensure its optimal functionality. As we start making it publicly available anyone will be able to submit an improvement proposals for it.\\n- On the decentralizing of PUSH Nnodes side, we are segregating nodes into modules. So, participants can spin up their own node and provide the service to the network to send notifications\\n- The <b>EPNS Smart Contract v1.5 Audit</b> is coming to its last stage. Many new features will come together as we deploy this new version of the smart contracts. More details will be provided soon!\\n- Content markdown standards for frontend SDK are in the works.\\n- <b>Wallet to Wallet</b> code reviews are done. Currently going over extensive testing and also working with design team to provide a great UI ready for launch.\\n- <b>EPNS dApp UI/UX improvements</b> for a better experience for channel creators and users. Also working on getting the sending notifications ready for multi-chain support.\\n\\nWith so many development efforts happening concurrently, there is so much room for conversation and discussion.

We highly appreciate our community involvement to ensure every release is rock solid.\\n\\n## Frens of EPNS \ud83c\udf8e\\n\\nNo month recap would be complete without briefly mentioning the Frens we made this month, and what we are building together with them:\\n\\n- [Pine Protocol](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1542553551901278211?s=20&t=GXkfWyIHO3c6E6AObcN6ag): with their platform providing permissionless instant loan transactions that evade the need for negotiations, providing also loan liquidation and expiration alerts helps users be on top of their operations at all times.\\n- [Sturdy](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1544728385733070854?s=20&t=ig7MxT6oSokwEmRJit6vSw): bringing timely notifications to users when their assets are in risk, but also notifying them about high APY opportunities available on the platform.\\n- [Quest3](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1546543616570433537?s=20&t=bjnec1ShgYxUwKg9uy5oQQ&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email): providing users with opportunities at their fingertips and keeping them informed when a new quest starts or is about to end.\\n- [Wonderverse](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1546902851976175616?s=20&t=5PBQj1Yka209QE2QTi620w): implementing into their Project Management offering notifications to users when anew task is assigned, or if the due dates for a task are approaching/reached.\\n- [Polychain Monsters](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1550163713013186560?s=20&t=XZHLvLfunThtEKeKS5naPA): this collaboration aims to to notify users about important events such as when rewards are sent, and even if you pulled a rare Polymon.\\n- [Cryptocurrency Jobs](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1552701299942367232?s=20&t=cd-LeFcxmiN7NQnZd9slqw): nothing beats getting new job opportunities delivered directly to you in a timely fashion so you are the first to act on it.
