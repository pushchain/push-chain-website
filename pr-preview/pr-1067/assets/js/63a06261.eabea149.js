With our new launch, the door is wide open for the Push ecosystem to grow dramatically and bring on new exciting use cases for our communication solutions.\\n\\nWith this announcement, weâ€™re excited to introduce our BNB launch Collaborators who are collaborating with Push on various use cases to bring web3 native notification and messaging to users across the BNB ecosystem.\\n\\n### Push and BNB: Decentralized communication to power web3 UX\\n\\nUsing Push, BNB dapp developers can begin adding notification services to their dapps, building custom communication channels, and enabling wallet-to-wallet communication for users (check out [this guide](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/tutorials/enabling-channel-on-other-chains/) for getting started). For end-users, this means enhanced capacity to stay updated on critical information relevant to their favorite dapps.\\n\\nThe BNB notification ecosystem will be available through the primary Push Protocol app: [app.push.org](http://app.push.org/). For users, you can follow this [user guide](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/s) to begin opting-in to channels.\\n\\nThis integration is a major step forward in Pushâ€™s mission to provide seamless and decentralized web3 communication and we are thrilled to have eight new frens from BNB joining our mission.\\n\\nLetâ€™s explore some interesting use cases these frens are deploying with Push.\\n\\n### Staying updated about critical events with Push notifications\\n\\nFor a powerful DEX aggregator like 1inch [Network](https://1inch.io/), rapid changes in token prices among various DEXes create the need for quick notifications. Thanks to Push, 1inch is now updating users on exchange rates, limit order executions, and expiry statuses eliminating the need for continuous monitoring of token exchange rates. Additionally, 1inch DAO can now send new governance proposal notifications directly to membersâ€™ wallet addresses using Push. 1inchers can [opt-in](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x1a9dDEf485674fC60a269cf97FAbc6b8728A3497) to the channel now, and start receiving notifications.\\n\\nCEX and DEX liquidity aggregator, [Orion Protocol](https://www.orionprotocol.io/), is the single point of access to the crypto market, combining the top crypto exchanges into [one order book](https://trade.orionprotocol.io/). Through Pushâ€™s seamless wallet-to-wallet technology, the Orion team can now keep users informed of their [developments](https://blog.orionprotocol.io/terminalupdates) via Push notifications.\\n\\nWith an ever-growing DeFi ecosystem and an increasing amount of on-chain activity, constant innovation is required to accommodate the growing needs of DeFi users. For one, users need to be updated about their positions and market conditions. Having to stay on top of market conditions and portfolio statutes 24/7 is exhausting. This is where notifications and real-time alerts prove useful.\\n\\nDeFi apps that require active management of positions can often lead to forgotten collateral and live loan positions. By sending real-time insights and liquidation alerts to users, liquidation can be avoided. For other critical events like price swings and changes in vault strategies, users can be notified to prompt timely action on their portfolios.\\n\\n### Improving access to DeFi tools\\n\\nUse cases are being established with [Apeswap](https://apeswap.finance/) to enhance access to DeFi tools like staking and farming. By alerting users when a new pool launches or new bonds are issued, users are given all the information they need to participate in the latest pool on time. Users can [opt-in](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x0e255B1900b8cE23f8E818C7Ee08cfd5b41df748) to the channel now, and start receiving notifications.\\n\\n[ZeroSwap](https://zeroswap.io/) is another protocol taking advantage of Push notifications to assist users with their trading strategies by updating them with the latest price information.\\n\\n### Enhanced governance and community participation\\n\\nAlmost every protocol thatâ€™s integrated Push is utilizing notifications to also enhance governance on their platform. For DAOs and decentralized exchanges like Sushi, community participation is key to the growth of their network.\\n\\nTo enable this trust and distributed decision-making, users need to stay on top of whatâ€™s happening. For [Sushi](https://www.sushi.com/), Push notifications are being used to update users about upcoming governance proposals within the forum as well as a medium for connecting with the community. Sushi channel is now live on Push, [opt-in here](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x458E4E1877F2F0D6752bD6f6DFd2e9048C2A56b3).\\n\\nDeFi apps like [Thena](https://thena.fi/) are implementing Push notifications to notify users to timely vote on their staking rewards program. Users can opt-in to [Thena channel](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xC59c69342eb0bF2635dac683e44cEB2A18a5C38d) now.\\n\\nGovernance is better with Push!\\n\\n### Increasing player retention and enhancing the Metaverse experience\\n\\nMetaverse and NFT gaming have been all the rage recently. But while the Metaverse space garners a lot of attention, lacking native web3 communication remains a major challenge. NFT-gaming platform, [Wombat](https://www.wombat.app/), is solving this problem by integrating Push into their platform. For an ecosystem that relies heavily on player-to-player interactions, native communication tools can go a long way in enhancing the overall UX of Wombat.\\n\\n[SecondLive](https://secondlive.world/), a create-to-earn open Metaverse, is also committed to providing the best user experience and is working with Push to enable native web3 communication within their Metaverse. By enabling Push notifications and Chat, SecondLive is able to create a decentralized and transparent communication channel between its platform and users.\\n\\n### Pushing for success together with Frens\\n\\nWhile a lot of interesting use cases have already been established with our new frens, this is only the start of an exciting journey on BNB Chain. There are a ton of applications for communication tools yet to be explored and we cannot wait to get started.\\n\\nStay updated on BNB Chain: [Website](https://www.bnbchain.org/en), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN), [Telegram](https://t.me/bnbchain), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BNBChainOfficial), [Discord](https://discord.gg/bnbchain), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bnbchaininnovation/), [Build Nâ€™ Build Forum](https://www.buildnbuild.dev/), [Dev Community](https://bnbdev.community/)"}}');
