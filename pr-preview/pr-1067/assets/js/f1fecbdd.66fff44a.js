The sheer number of opportunities now available in DeFi, for investors, entrepreneurs, and arbitrageurs are mind-boggling. DeFi\u2019s trusty yield farming and staking are still working wonders bringing an influx of new users into DeFi every day.\\n\\nAlong with this, cryptocurrency-based derivatives have also been picking up steam recently. Options and futures are now among the most popular financial products on crypto exchanges. Now, even limit orders are being introduced to DeFi with the emergent Symphony Finance and we\u2019re pleased to be working with the protocol in their journey of becoming DeFi\u2019s go-to trading protocol.\\n\\n### How Symphony Finance Can Benefit from EPNS\\n\\nSymphony Finance has built one of DeFi\u2019s first yield optimized limit protocols called \u201cYOLO\u201d. It aims to maximize the total returns users can reap by combining limit orders with yield farming. For the uninitiated, limit orders are financial products that allow the owner to set their own limit price to either buy or sell an asset. If the limit price is reached, the order is executed.\\n\\nIn this context, Symphony Finance\u2019s YOLO allows users to create limit orders for digital assets by depositing the sold asset. The asset is then deposited by the protocol on yield farming protocols like AAVE, Mstable, and Yearn. This way, the underlying asset generates yield continuously for the user. If the limit price is reached the limit order is automatically executed and the user receives the asset along with all the generated yield.\\n\\nApart from yield generation YOLO has other great features like \u201cLiquidity Aggregation\u201d, which benefits the users by filling their limit orders at the best price. YOLO also guarantees the orders get executed once the prices are there in the market by eliminating the need for \u201cTakers\u201d. In the context of YOLO, the integrated DEXes act as Takers. Stop loss is another feature that YOLO provides although this feature is not available in many orderbook DEXes in DeFi today.\\n\\nFor all these processes in Symphony Finance to run smoothly, the protocol needs a means of direct communication with its users, and what better than EPNS to make this happen.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our collaboration with Symphony Finance, we aim to facilitate decentralized push notifications for investors, traders, and users of the protocol. These decentralized notifications can become a reliable means for the protocol to communicate with its users.\\n\\nUsers can subscribe to the official Symphony Finance channel on the EPNS and opt to receive notifications. Whenever the users\u2019 orders are executed on Symphony, users are immediately intimated. This eliminates the need for them to manually check on their limit order status, reducing friction between the protocol and users.\\n\\nAs Symphony Finance strives to create futuristic financial products for DeFi users, we\u2019re pleased to join them on this journey and hope to become an integral part of their operations."}}')}}]);
