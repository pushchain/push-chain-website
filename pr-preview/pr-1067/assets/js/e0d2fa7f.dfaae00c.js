It is a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain\\nbuilt to allow developers to create universal apps and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s, and L3s enabling transactions from any chain - any app and any user.\\n\\n[Explore more about Push Chain here](https://push.org)\\n\\n## Bringing zkLink to Push Chain\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc65\xa0What does this mean for zkLink and Push Chain Users?\\n\\n**Interact with any non-evm app, without leaving zkLink**\\n\\nPush Chain extends the aggregation capabilities of zkLink enabling zkLink users to easily interact with and explore non-evm ecosystems like Solana, Aptos and Cosmos - all without leaving the operational comfort offered by zkLink.\\n\\nNo need to create new wallets, learn and follow complex bridging steps- simply utilize Push Chain to seamlessly interplay between zkLink and the non-evm ecosystem\\n\\n**Unified Experience**\\n\\nSince zkLink aggregates Ethereum networks and serves as a unified point of access, users from non-evm space can easily leverage Push Chain to explore and interact with EVM space- abstracting away all the manual complexities traditionally faced by non-EVM users when transacting on EVM chains.\\n\\nAll of the above with the advantage of - instant finality, security and superfast execution.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc77\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\xa0What does this mean for builders?\\n\\n**Build super abstracted - shared settlement apps**\\n\\nWith shared settlement capabilities of Push Chain and zkLink - devs can build apps with powerful chain, fee and wallet abstraction capabilities - allowing transactions from any chain with near-instant finality.\\n\\n**Build universally compliant consumer and mixed financial apps**\\n\\nPush Chain introduces a new transaction type: **\u2018consumer transactions\u2019**, where transaction ordering is not essential.\\n\\nWhy consumer tx?\\n\\nTwo major challenges hinder the scalability of consumer web3 apps:\\n\\n- **Chain Fragmentation:** User bases are over-diversified across hundreds of chains, impeding user growth, UX and retention.\\n- **Scalability constraints** Most chains process transactions in a strictly ordered manner, which imposes unnecessary constraints on apps that don\u2019t rely on transaction ordering.\\n\\nThis is where Push Chain\u2019s Consumer Tx feature enables non-financial and consumer applications to operate with lightning-fast speed and hyper-scalability. Push Chain enables these apps to manage millions of users seamlessly across any chain environment.\\n\\n[Learn more about Push Chain\u2019s Innovations here](https://push.org/blog/innovations-by-push-chain/)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd13\xa0Use case unlock:\\n\\n**Chain Agnostic AI Agents** - Push Chain\u2019s universal shared state and ZKLink\u2019s [application abstraction](https://blog.zk.link/zklink-research-roadmap-ai-agents-in-application-abstraction-fff297ef4577) pave the way for a new generation of chain-agnostic AI agents. These agents can perform autonomous operations in a borderless manner - unlocking a wide variety of financial, mixed financial, and non-financial use cases.\\n\\n**Universal Domains** - Applications like [ZNS Connect](https://zns.bio/) can utilize Push IDs- ( A unified user identity by Push Chain that spans every user wallet, both EVM and non-EVM) to expand their domain capabilities with unified analytics, user footprint tracking and universal resolution.\\n\\n**Unified Liquidity Markets** - EVM-bound liquidity markets like [Lido](https://lido.fi/), [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/swap), and [Native](https://native.org/app/credit-pool/) can utilize fee and chain abstraction features of Push Chain to seamlessly allow non-evm Liquidity Providers to effortlessly participate in market-making opportunities within a few clicks with no extra UX overhead.\\n\\n**Universal Prediction Markets** - Where users from zkLink and other chains can collectively speculate on real-life events. Markets can aggregate liquidity from all chains simultaneously bringing more user traction and better yield opportunities.\\n\\n## **\ud83c\udf0c**\xa0What does this mean for Web3?\\n\\n**Unifying experiences by bringing users together.**\\n\\nPush Chain isn\u2019t here to replace networks or compete with any; instead, it aims to eliminate the fragmented state of Web3 by unifying settlement across all chains under one universal shared state, unlocking a seamless, interconnected Web3 experience.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n1. Follow [@PushChain](https://x.com/PushChain) on X to get the latest updates about Push Chain\\n2. Check out the\xa0[Push Chain Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.push.org/) for a detailed overview of the vision and the underlying technicalities.\\n3. Visit the\xa0[Push Chain Website](https://push.org/chain)\xa0to find a one-pager explanation of the vision.\\n4. [Push Chain Devnet](https://scan.push.org/?)\xa0is running live on Proof-of-Stake network validators, storage and archival nodes. The network already supports consumer transactions as well.\\n5.
