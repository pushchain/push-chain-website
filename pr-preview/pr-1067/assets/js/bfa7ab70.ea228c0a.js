But our journey doesn\u2019t stop here. Let\u2019s dive into the exciting updates for March from the Push Ecosystem:\\n\\n### Partnership Updates\\n\\nWe\u2019ve seen a surge in clients integrating our notifications and messaging services. Some of our notable partners include [Verso Wallet](https://get-verso.com/), [DEXYNTH](https://www.dexynth.com/), [Outposts](https://outposts.io/), [Bitget](https://twitter.com/bitgetglobal), [AlphaX](https://alphax.finance/), [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.foundation/), [RoseonX](https://roseon.world/), and many more.

This feature helps users manage their notifications at their own pace.We introduced a \'guest\' mode on our dApp, making it easier than ever to explore Push without connecting your wallet\\n\\nWe also benchmarked our [Push Chat Architecture](https://push.org/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message/) to make Push Chat work more efficiently. We launched the [Price Tracker Channel](https://www.notion.so/Push-x-Berachain-Spaces-Creative-Changes-5756710613b74055baa39ba4d534fe33?pvs=21) to help users get notified directly when their chosen cryptocurrency hits their desired price target.\\n\\n### Community Engagement\\n\\nWe\u2019ve been actively engaging with our vibrant community through various initiatives. We hosted a demo session for Push Nodes and awarded Push Alpha access NFT to over 700 users.\\n\\nOur \u201cDecentralize with Push Campaign\u201d led to the acquisition of more than 4,200 new users. We also unveiled [Tokenomics V2](https://push.org/blog/push-tokenomics-v2-engine/) for the $PUSH token.\\n\\nTo celebrate the listing of the $PUSH token on the Bitget Global exchange, we ran a quest campaign. We also announced the ultra-rare role \u201cPush Chad\u201d for our community.\\n\\n### Ecosystem Highlights\\n\\nIn March, we featured ETH Gas Price Tracker, [CryptoJobsList](https://cryptojobslist.com/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), and [Bankless](https://www.bankless.com/) as the Push Channel of the Week.\\n\\n### DAO\\n\\nWe launched the Push Grants V3 initiative to support builders in the Push Ecosystem. We also welcomed [Ian](https://twitter.com/ExpatCrypto3) as our new DAO Relations Lead and [Carla](https://twitter.com/carlaupgrade) as our Community DAO Relations role for push_dao.\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019ve made and look forward to what the future holds for the Push Ecosystem.
