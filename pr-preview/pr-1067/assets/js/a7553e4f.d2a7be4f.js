By focusing their unique talents however they saw fit, users could tag their submissions on Twitter with **#RockstarsofEPNS** for a chance to win the weekly prize and title.\\n\\nEvery week for the past year the Push Governance team (led by Miss Walter) chose 4 submissions weekly and then gave $PUSH holders the chance to vote on the nominees through our Snapshot voting page. The weekly prize for best submission was then entitled to 2400 $PUSH and an EPNS-inspired NFT created by our local Indian community.\\n\\nTo date, we have paid out ~120,000 $PUSH along with 50 unique NFTs to our Rockstar winners!
