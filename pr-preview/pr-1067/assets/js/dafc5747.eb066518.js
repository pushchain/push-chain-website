Vivek is currently growing Gitcoin, researching blockchain, and building community through Titans :)\\n\\nWe met Vivek at [Gitcoin Kernel accelerator](https://twitter.com/Sim_Pop/status/1281269625729306624), a 8-week invite only program for top tech talent in blockchain and Web 3, and immediately hit off. Sharing the vision of open source, \u201ccommunity first\u201d sustainable Web3 service, we are honored to have him join the team. Also, happy to share Block 2 KERNEL Fellowship starts January 2021 [Apply](https://apply.kernel.community/).\\n\\nWe will be closely working with Vivek to shape and align EPNS to be a community first service [principled](https://kernel.community/) around **Trust**, **Value**, **Freedom** and **Giving**. Notifications are a basic necessity for any dApps / smart contracts / web3 services that truly want to build a better web3 and for that to happen, a decentralized communication layer needs to be built\u2026 **one that provides equal opportunities to all dApps to send notifications to their users, which follows web3 ethos and is capable of carrying these notifications to any platform including crypto wallets, mobile apps and web browsers.**\\n\\nIn taking the advisor role, Vivek said:\\n\\n> EPNS is building critical infrastructure for Web 3. Tinkering with the incentives around notifications has huge downstream potential as we look to build an internet which serves users, not corporations. Excited to see how Harsh and Richa\u2019s vision unfolds.\\n\\nThanks Vivek for your mentorship and we are honored to welcome you to the EPNS family!\\n\\nStay in touch with Push!
