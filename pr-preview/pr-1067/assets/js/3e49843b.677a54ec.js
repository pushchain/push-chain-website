How is QuickSwap using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\nQuickSwap will be using Push\u2019s Web3 communication layer to enable push notifications for DeFi users on the DEX who want to be alerted about their positions and any other on-chain actions related to swaps, LP, farms, leverage trades, etc.\\n\\n### 5. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\nIt\u2019s a pretty smooth UI and easy to understand, I like the simplicity. It seems to also offer a wide range of notifications and features\\n\\n### 6. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\nPerhaps besides just on-chain actions users could have a checklist of things they want to opt into for each protocol, such as other types of news feeds, updates on token listings, etc.\\n\\n## About Quickswap\\n\\nQuickSwap stands as a next-generation layer-2 DEX and AMM operating on Polygon.
