In the case of [KERNEL](https://kernel.community/) (a [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) collective) those numbers represent 500+ developers, researchers, entrepreneurs, artists, designers, investors and incredible humans interested in Web 3.0. It is with great pleasure that we announce KERNEL is joining the EPNS advisory board.\\n\\nWith a shared vision to build a better web, we look forward to strategic guidance from the KERNEL community as we build out a critical communication component of Ethereum and Web 3.0, decentralized communication, including:\\n\\n- Insight into developer issues and requirements for Web 3.0 services\\n- The pulse of the Web 3.0 industry and latest technological developments\\n- An understanding of cross-chain communication integration issues and value stream creation opportunities\\n\\nWeb 3.0 developers are at the forefront of building scalable and interoperable blockchains and protocols for next generation permissionless networks. Yet as cross-chain communication becomes standard, the users of the dApps, platforms, and smart contracts deploying on these blockchains still lack a decentralized communication medium.\\n\\nAs we develop the missing piece of Web 3.0 infrastructure \u2014 a blockchain agnostic decentralized middleware messaging solution for any dApp, smart contract, or Web 3.0 service \u2014 KERNEL provides an important communication channel with talented Web 3.0 entrepreneurs early in their journey. We hope to build EPNS alongside them!\\n\\nKERNEL brings together the Web 3.0 community through events that develop the thinking skills, innovative tools, and decentralized solutions to succeed at Web 3.0 projects. Their main program, a KERNEL Block, is an 8-week program bringing together 250 talented individuals in Web 3 for peer-to-peer sharing, learning and mentorship from industry leaders through talks and fireside chats. Over 600 KERNEL Alumni, 50+ KERNEL Companies, and support from Gitcoin help guide the community as it supports projects like EPNS.\\n\\nThrough KERNEL\u2019s dedication to nurturing deep bonds in the Web 3.0 community, EPNS will not only benefit from direct guidance and advice. By being part of a strong Web 3.0 community, we can foster deep relationships with peers in KERNEL where EPNS can learn, grow and continuously evolve our own products for the Web 3.0 community.\\n\\nTaking the advisor role, Gitcoin KERNEL (Vivek Singh) said:\\n\\n> EPNS (Harsh and Richa, specifically) are shining stars who we are grateful to have in KERNEL. They are a thoughtful leadership team suited to explore how internet communication protocols (starting with notifications) can be implemented in more harmonious and humane ways.\\n\\n## **ABOUT KERNEL**\\n\\nKERNEL is a Web 3 family. It breathes through the deep bonds created amongst 600 (and counting) builders in Web 3 who have joined an 8 week experience called a KERNEL Block. Building something new in Web 3? We\u2019d love for you to consider joining us for the next block, [KB3](http://kernel.community).\\n\\nKERNEL speakers and mentors include Vitalik Buterin, Dandelion Mane, Linda Xie, Juan Benet, Simona Pop, Andy Tudhope, Morgan Beller, Jesse Walden, and 100+ more.\\n\\nStay in touch with Gitcoin KERNEL!
