Oftentimes, DeFi protocols tend to act as gatekeepers to _which_ projects are allowed to be a part of their lending and borrowing pools; thereby barring a majority of DeFi projects from participation in the DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nUniLend is a permission-less decentralized protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and borrowing services through smart contracts. Even with the openness and permissionless features, one of the major gatekeepers of major adoption and user experience has always been the communication gap in the DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nTo help UniLend overcome this barrier and to truly unlock the potential of digital assets for their users, we are glad to announce our pilot program with UniLend Finance to provide decentralized push notifications to their users.\\n\\n## **Why is there a need for notifications in UniLend? \u2014 The Problem**\\n\\nUnlike other DeFi protocols out there, UniLend allows you to list ERC20s in a permissionless way on their platform, and also allows you to trade (spot trading), lend and borrow with interest and even perform Flash Loans on any ERC20 asset with liquidity, easily on their interface. This opens up a whole new door for projects that are not listed on other lending platforms who only provide permissioned access to list their projects as pools.\\n\\nBy leveraging these features, UniLend acts as an infrastructure that solves the problems of fragmentation and limited functionality in the current DeFi lending ecosystem by supporting and offering comprehensive functionality for a vast range of digital assets. However the lack of communication in the current state of DeFi protocols means that users of UniLend face trouble when they are not able to know when:\\n\\n- Their favorite cryptos are listed on UniLend\\n- When their loans are about to get liquidated\\n- When their trade (spot trade) has gone through\\n- If their flash loan was successfully executed\\n- When new governance proposals are listed\\n- When new airdrops are announced\\n\\n> \u201cUniLend is excited to integrate EPNS\u2019s decentralized push notification service into our tech stack. This will create a more transparent overall user experience and give users engaging with our platform a more user-focused feel.\u201d _Chandresh Aharwar, UniLend Co-founder & CEO_\\n\\nWithout the provision of instant real-time notifications for spot trades, and lending & borrowing; users may not be able to stay up to date on their loans, trades, and positions on UniLend. If they want to, users would need to keep a track of their positions by continuously logging back in to the dApp, to make sure their loans are not liquidated, or they need to scour social media to check if there are any new airdrops or giveaways happening on UniLend.\\n\\n## **Instant EPNS Magic! \u2014 The Solution**\\n\\nThe state of service-client relationship and communication is strictly restricted by Web2 infrastructure such as Telegram, Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Medium, etc. This not only results in fragmentation of sources of information but also results in a void in user personalization.In this age of Web3 technology, it is still a burning issue in how to create trustworth and efficient communication medium for services and users without invading their Web3 privacy.\\n\\n> \u201cThis partnership allows us at EPNS to not only support Unilend\u2019s journey to true decentralization, but also provide them with a decentralized communication infrastructure to further their decentralization agenda\u201d commented Harsh Rajat, founder EPNS.\\n\\nBy integrating with EPNS, the communication between services and users are greatly improved which also allows for a much more personalized user experience and completely uses Web3 decentralized infrastructure along with decentralized identity integrations in the near future \u2014 users can now receive alerts and notifications on events that concern them, their trade and loan positions, and also get to learn about major events, airdrops, governance proposals, and other announcements right at their fingertips without having to wander through the project\u2019s social media all the time.\\n\\n## **The Crossover \u2014 What we will achieve**\\n\\nEPNS will work with the UniLend team to set up channel _(see our_ [_litepaper_](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-whitepaper/blob/master/Ethereum%20Push%20Notification%20Service%20Litepaper.pdf) _for definitions of channels, services, and more)_ to allow users to receive notifications directly on user wallets without any hassle, these channels will allow for use cases that encourage users to be more in control of information, and hence be more confident to make more educated decisions on their trades and stay on top of their DeFi game always.\\n\\nUniLend users through EPNS will be able to:\\n\\n- Learn when new tokens are listed on the dApp\\n- Learn the status of their swap or spot trade\\n- Learn when new governance proposals or airdrops are announced\\n- Get notified when their Flash Loan goes through.\\n- Customize notifications according to their preferences and priorities\\n\\n## **$PUSH Liquidity + Flash Loans!**\\n\\nUniLend is one of the first and only protocols that provides Flash Loan functionality to chains in addition to Ethereum. Flash Loans are more gas-efficient and cost lesser fees on the protocol, when compared to their competitors. Due to its nature of permissionless listing and Flash Loan fees as less as **_0.05%_**, adding $PUSH liquidity to UniLend\u2019s protocol allows $PUSH to be Flash Loaned and allows traders to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities, which also opens up many other trading strategies for $PUSH.\\n\\nThis creates a new revenue generating use case for $PUSH tokens & allows token holders to earn staking rewards & airdrops \ud83e\ude82\\n\\nStakers on UniLend also get a share of the Flash Loans fee that are collected, as **70% of the Flash Loans Fee goes to the Staking Pool.** With UniLend\u2019s easy UX, the rewards are given instantly to the stakers and added to the liquidity pool and restaked.\\n\\nBy working with UniLend we are able to expand UniLend\u2019s vision of following the Web3 ethos of decentralization. By allowing permissionless listing of tokens on their platform, UniLend allows any project to be able to leverage interest based lending and borrowing with collateralization which is usually restricted to only certain projects by most other platforms. By taking this approach, UniLend wants to embrace the Web3 ethos of decentralization and allow anyone to be a part of the larger DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nWe are absolutely thrilled and honored to work with UniLend, and look forward to their users receiving decentralized push notifications that improve their overall user and trading experience.\\n\\n## **About UniLend Finance**\\n\\nUniLend is a permission-less decentralized DeFi protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and borrowing services through smart contracts.\\n\\nStay in touch with UniLend Finance!
