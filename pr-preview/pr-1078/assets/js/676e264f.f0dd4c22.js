Feels amazing to be with the Bundle Crypto Community.\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: We\u2019re happy to have you here\\n\\nRicha: Thanks Joshuaez for the intro. Hello Awesome Bundle Africa community, great to be here \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: You\u2019re welcome \ud83d\ude4c\\n\\nHarsh: We are founders of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS for short). Think a little intro about EPNS and our team is in order before diving deep into all things Ethereum :).\\n\\n**Our Team**\\n\\nHuge Shoutout to Our Awesome Team!! We are a global team located across continents including Asia, Africa, North America, Central America \ud83d\ude42 Our team brings varied experience and skills across domains and has helped shape the project with a single goal of building a unique product which did not exist.\\n\\n**About EPNS**\\n\\nEPNS is solving the problem of communication, or the lack thereof in Web 3.0. We are creating a decentralized notification protocol that any dApps or smart contracts or any services can use to notify their users (wallet addresses).\\n\\nBut that\u2019s not just it, you as a user are always in control, and are able to passively earn from it as well! And that\u2019s where our DeFi aspects kicks in. Apart from that, we made the deal sweeter by ensuring that users are able to receive these notifications anywhere they want aka EPNS is platform agnostic :).\\n\\nAnd now let\u2019s get started\u2026 We have planned the following list of questions for all you awesome folks though feel free to ask us anything which you think we might have missed and we would love to dive deeper:\\n\\n**\\\\- What is Ethereum?**\\n\\n**\\\\- What is Blockchain?**\\n\\n**\\\\- What is Ethereum\u2026 again?**\\n\\n**\\\\- When was Ethereum created and who created it?**\\n\\n**\\\\- What does the future look like?**\\n\\nRicha: **What is Ethereum?**\\n\\nTo understand Ethereum, we need to understand what is blockchain though I am sure many of you would already know \ud83d\ude09 but here goes nothing.\\n\\n**What is Blockchain?**\\n\\nI am glad you asked\u2026 haha. Blockchain simply put is a way to ensure that any historical data when put in it becomes non tamperable, this is exciting for many reasons but as you might have guessed already. The most fascinating use case of it is that for the very first time in history. We finally have a way to create a form of money that is non-tamperable (not dependent on the whims of a government), unique and truly limited (ie: gold can be found, money can be minted but 1 BTC is always 0.00000004% of total Bitcoin. Same for Ethereum which brings us to addressing the next question.\\n\\nHarsh: Thanks Richa\u2026 seems like you just wrote it and didn\u2019t prepare it in advance at all\u2026 haha\\n\\nHarsh: Alright! so let me handle the next one\\n\\n**What is Ethereum\u2026 again?**\\n\\nEthereum is the second most popular blockchain after Bitcoin as per the market cap. Though unlike Bitcoin which is usually touted as the next innovation in the concept of Money, ETH use cases are aligned more towards creating decentralized applications that can do much more than just transfer money. This is usually done by creating smart contracts which is code executed on blockchain through EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).\\n\\nThese decentralized applications, often called dApps open up a whole new range of utility for blockchain space. Most of you must be aware of DeFi which is majorly built in the Ethereum ecosystem, simply defined, it\u2019s finance on blockchain including lending, borrowing and some other cool use cases.\\n\\nFor example, we now have tokens on Ethereum that have interest built into them which means that they keep on increasing passively (aDAI for example) without you as a user doing anything. This is a big feat, because it paves the way for banking to be on blockchain with interest rates that are global instead of country to county. In the US, the yield or interest rate is often so low on your savings account that it doesn\u2019t make sense but DeFi fixes by offering 5% or more APR (Annual Percentage Rate).\\n\\nThis is not the only utility that can be tapped in, self sovereign identity is another use case. Having control over your data and moving it with you is again a huge advantage. NFTs and Auctions are again something smart contracts open up and so much more. The field is really early but it offers vast improvements over the traditional services.\\n\\nFor example, we at EPNS utilize the DeFi smart contracts to ensure that not only users (wallet addresses) are able to receive notifications but they are able to earn from them as well :).\\n\\n**When was Ethereum created and who created it?**\\n\\nEthereum was released on 30 July 2015 though was proposed in late 2013. While Vitalik was always been associated with Ethereum, It also had a lot more co-founders. Some of the prominent ones are Joseph Lubin (Founder of Consensys) and Gavin Wood (Creator of Polkadot).\\n\\nRicha: Great @harshr, let me handle the next one!\\n\\nHarsh: \ud83d\ude4c\\n\\nRicha : **What does the future looks like ?**:\\n\\nThe future of ETH is only bound by the imaginations of the developers building on top of it. You can practically build anything on top of it and most of the time it will always be better than what we have in terms of current technology services which relies on the server/client technology model, where in we as client are always dependent on the whims of the server to provide us with access and trust what we see.\\n\\nThe future of groundbreaking tech though really depends on scalability and speed. Both of which is what we see ETH 2.0 and several Layer 2 services on ETH trying to tackle. This race has actually always been chasing the Blockchain Trilemma, where it has been dictated that you can only choose to have two out of three things in your blockchain: Security, Scalability and Decentralization.\\n\\nThe one to achieve this blockchain trilemma is going to be the one that changes the entire web 3.0 landscape and Ethereum is well poised to do so. Another shameless plug, so apart from the blockchain trilemma, we also feel that communication as in services coming to users instead of other way round (like how it is currently in blockchain) is another thing which will help a blockchain win, that\u2019s us btw ;).\\n\\nFuture of Ethereum looks awesome. One thing that Ethereum has gotten going for itself is the awesome community they have been able to gather and what we have seen so far is that community is resilient to the platform they come to, so it\u2019s not easy to make them switch, that\u2019s why many blockchains even when they are a bit better than ETH sometime in terms of speed is still not able to provide quality and useful smart contracts (or dApps) that Ethereum ecosystem is able to provide..\\n\\nHarsh: Thanks Richa for tackling the question, @Joshuaez Think we are done with this segment and can move to next \ud83d\ude42\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: Great, thank you for the awesome Session.\\n\\nSurely you guys explain all we needed to know about Ethereum.\\n\\nHarsh:\ud83d\ude4f\\n\\nRicha: \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\\n\\n# Segment 2: Community Questions\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: So, this brings us to segment 2, we\u2019ll open the group so our members can ask questions, then you\u2019ll will select and answer the 5 most insightful questions.\\n\\nRicha: sure, sounds good\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: The group will be open in..\\n\\n5\ufe0f\u20e3\\n\\n4\ufe0f\u20e3\\n\\n3\ufe0f\u20e3\\n\\n2\ufe0f\u20e3\\n\\n1\ufe0f\u20e3\\n\\nQ: Will ethereum surpass Bitcoin in value?\\n\\nQ: Could you explain more about EPNS?\\n\\nQ: You explained in the write up that Ethereum aimed at decentralized applications. My question is, is there any relationship between Ethereum and Ethereum classic? And is Ethereum classic a sub under Ethereum?\\n\\nQ: \ud83d\udd36How will the Ethereum 2.0 protocol affect the price of ETH, it\u2019s efficiency and scalability over the coming months and years?\\n\\nQ: Ethereum push notifications, are they only peculiar to dapps and smart contract address or to the whole Ethereum address?\\n\\nQ: Can you please explain the basic different between Ethereum and Ethereum Push Notification\\n\\nQ: You made mention of tokens that generates interest without doing anything, are these interest dependent on the price of such token?\\n\\nQ: Who are the remaining founder apart from the one listed\\n\\nQ: How does gas fee affect eth workability\\n\\nQ: Privacy is one of the strength and flaws of the Blockchain technology today, what\u2019s the level of privacy on messages sent over EPNS?\\n\\nQ: Has EPNS been launched and what\u2019s the your teams roadmap for its deployment\\n\\nQ: What is the effect of the DApp in Ethereum price\\n\\nQ: How does ethereum smart contract works?\\n\\nQ: There are over 10,000 cryptos, and some are built on Ethereum blockchain as we know.\\n\\nSo what\u2019s the probability that this very project is unique in its utility and would drag attention and mass adoption amongst other Ethereum Defi\u2019s ? Kindly state why, how and the strategies you would deploy in the crypto market !\\n\\nQ: What is the Ethereum network?\\n\\nQ: What is the level of privacy on messages sent over EPNS.\\n\\nQ: What are the real-world use-cases of Ethereum?\\n\\nQ: I still don\u2019t understand how we can earn passively in EPNS, and is it risk-free?\\n\\nQ: Over the years, Ethereum has always had the highest transfer charges\u2026at a time, it was close to $20\u2026does ESPN bring a solution.to.this?\\n\\nIf yes, How?\\n\\n**Responses to top 5 Questions by EPNS team**\\n\\n**Q1. There are over 10,000 cryptos, and some are built on Ethereum blockchain as we know.**\\n\\n**So what\u2019s the probability that this very project is unique in its utility and would drag attention and mass adoption amongst other Ethereum Defi\u2019s ? Kindly state why, how and the strategies you would deploy in the crypto market !**\\n\\nAwesome question!\\n\\nYou are right. There are 1000s of projects and tokens in the cryptosphere.\\n\\nWhat makes us more attractive and unique is that we are in our core an Infrastructure project. We are helping set a solid foundation so the entire Ethereum Ecosystem can grow.\\n\\nWe are a project in service of other projects!\\n\\nWe found a very interesting mix on how to create a win-win situation for all participants.\\n\\nBusiness will increase customer attraction and retention, and clients will earn from all this.\\n\\nWin-Win!\\n\\n**Q2. What is the level of privacy on messages sent over EPNS.**\\n\\nWe had an eye on the privacy of the messages from the very start :). There are three levels of privacy on EPNS currently and it all depends on what the service wants to communicate to their users (subscribers).\\n\\na) Broadcast \u2014 This type of message is plain and is more like how a person communicates over twitter to their followers, useful in getting critical information or alerts out like a security audit, bug, governance voting or even an awesome AMA.\\n\\nb) Targeted \u2014 This type of message is still plain but meant for a specific user, kind of like when your loan is about to be liquidated or your ENS domain is expiring or your wallet has seen movement of funds (incoming / outgoing). These are information that are out in public domain and hence doesn\u2019t need encryption\\n\\nc) Encrypted \u2014 These are as the name suggests encrypted and only the user will be able to see them. We do it via public / private key encryption which means the message is encrypted using your public key so your private key can only open it and thus you as the user is only able to see it, this is very similar to how Bitcoin or Ethereum encryption operates and hence is very secure\\n\\nWhile these are the three privacy level we support currently, the beauty of our protocol is that it\u2019s infinitely extensible which means other more complex privacy level can be added in the future and they will be automagically available for the services / users to use.\\n\\n**Q3. I still don\u2019t understand how we can earn passively in EPNS, and is it risk-free?**\\n\\nSure! Happy to answer and of course it\u2019s totally risk free, in fact you as a user never have to deposit anything on our protocol, you just earn token incentives magically :).\\n\\nWhile designing the EPNS decentralized notification protocol we wanted to design a WIN-WIN scenario for both the Users (receivers of the notifications) as well as Services (senders of the notification).\\n\\nOur protocol requires a service to activate themselves before they can send notifications, this is a one time step and the activation requires deposit a one-time stake fee.\\n\\nThis stake fee is then automatically lend out to AAVE protocol and starts generating interest. This generated interest is then distributed to the subscribers of the channel (service) in a weighted fashion thus making the notifications incentivized for the users :).\\n\\nYou can also deep dive about it in our whitepaper.\\n\\n**Q4. How does gas fee affect eth workability**\\n\\nAnother great question. ETH works on the concept of gas, which means that any operation you do is charged as units of gas, the gas fee is essentially the current ongoing rate of gas in Ether (ETH).\\n\\nSince ETH is more like a decentralized computer for all the smart contracts running over it, this also means that apart from the transfer of ETH from one party to another, it is also used for countless other operations (like calculations you do in your code) for different things in a smart contract.\\n\\nThese things can be computationally expensive at times or might be meager which means they have different gas requirements, and since gas price is measured in ether, the gas fee is always done as gas_required_for_an_operation X current_gas_price\\n\\nThis means that if the current_gas_price (measured in ETH) goes up than the transaction becomes more expensive to perform. As with the rule of demand and supply, if the gas fee is higher, the network becomes expensive to use and thereby will have less people using it.\\n\\nThis is the reason why gas fee affect eth workablitily\\n\\n**Q5. You explained in the write up that Ethereum aimed at decentralized applications. My question is, is there any relationship between Ethereum and Ethereum classic? And is Ethereum classic a sub under Ethereum?**\\n\\nIt\u2019s a really nice question. Ethereum classic is a fork of Ethereum and in some way the original chain. Not many are aware now, but when Ethereum was launched, shortly after that, a hacker was able to drain majority of Ethereum funds out through a DAO hack.\\n\\nThis led Vitalik and co to fork the main chain to invalidate these transactions and led to the age old question that if code is a law then should it be forked? Nevertheless, some people believe and still do that code is law and they stuck to the original chain which became Ethereum Classic and the new chain became known as Ethereum.\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: Wow, this are excellent answers, thank you Richa and Harsh, you guys are awesome.\\n\\nHarsh: Thanks again for hosting us @Joshuaez!
