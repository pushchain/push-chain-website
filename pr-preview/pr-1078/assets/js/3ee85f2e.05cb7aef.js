It has consistently delivered very attractive yields to participants in both of the pools available. We have observed yields above 210% APR for the Uniswap LP Pool (UNI-V2) through the entire month and above 115% APR for the PUSH Staking pool.\\n\\nMake sure to take a look at this awesome explainer video from Defi Dad.\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{borderRadius: \'32px\'}}  src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Maq-KxPv8W4\\" title=\\"How to Earn 120-210% APR Yield Farming with The Ethereum Push Notification Service\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\nAdditionally, we recently updated the [Community Incentives website](http://incentives.epns.io/) to show more information about your position in a pool and enabled support for Wallet Connect and Ledger. Also, we are adding APR & APY percentages soon.\\n\\nTalking about community, our [Community #ROCKSTAR NFT](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf) drop keeps setting the bar higher and higher. From deep community involvement and contributions to the project, dApps, Infographics, and more. Can\u2019t wait to see where creativity will take our awesome community next month!\\n\\n# \ud83d\udce2 Q2 Roadmap: Status Update\\n\\n![First Image](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n## Pilot Program Collaboration Updates\\n\\nWe are making steady progress building channels with:\\n\\n- [**Uniswap**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/accelerating-defi-with-epns-f2cbfaa33c91): to notify users about new governance proposals. The channel has passed an initial validation from the EPNS side, and we will soon be working on adjustments and improvements based on Uniswap\u2019s team feedback.\\n\\n![Second Image](./image-2.gif)\\n\\n- [**Clr.fund**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/advancing-clr-fund-funding-protocol-with-web3notifs-366b61408aa3): to notify users regarding events like rounds starting/finalizing, when contributions are received, when funds claimed, and when a tally is published. This channel is currently in development, and we are working closely with the CLR.fund team to speed up the process.\\n- [**Alpha Homora**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/we-alpha-homora-innovations-in-defi-with-epns-3873f74dc48): to notify users about upcoming liquidations of leveraged positions. We are working against the latest version of the AH contracts, and the channel will be ready for testing soon.\\n- Surprise channel announcement soon \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n## Collaboration announcements\\n\\n- With [**Ceramic Network**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/advancing-ceramic-networks-decentralized-identity-network-with-epns-264b24a7508f) to explore sending notifications through a user\u2019s DID.\\n- With [**bZx**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-partners-with-bzx-to-deliver-crucial-margin-trading-push-notifications-to-wallets-a2f52e4fcefe) to send margin lending and trading notifications directly to bZx user wallets.\\n- With [**Unilend**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-partners-with-unilend-finance-to-deliver-notifications-for-permissionless-money-markets-e647300b68ce) to notify users about new tokens listings, status of swap and spot trades, governance proposals, airdrops, and when a Flash Loan goes through.\\n- With [**Charged Particles**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/advancing-charged-particles-interest-bearing-nfts-with-epns-dc5643325300) to notify users about NFT deposits, interest earned and more actions in the Charged Particles platform.\\n- With [**YAM Finance**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/bringing-power-of-web3notif-to-the-awesome-yam-community-95d8a39ed86c) to notify users about liquidation risks, and governance actions.\\n- With [**PlotX**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-partners-with-plotx-to-bring-push-notifications-to-defi-prediction-markets-6b63952d46f6) to send all prediction market trading notifications directly to PlotX user wallets.\\n\\n## Completing EPNS Protocol v1\\n\\n- Full protocol test cases coverage is in the code review stage.\\n- Adding capabilities to delegate other wallets to Send Notifications on behalf of a channel.\\n- Ensuring upgradeability capabilities.\\n\\n## Backend SDKs\\n\\nThis is currently a work in progress for our team. We have been taking into consideration not only what we had planned since the start of the year, but also all the feedback and questions received from the community mostly through our Discord server. We are aiming to release an npm package that will allow developers to easily interface with the EPNS protocol to perform its most basic set of functions, starting with Sending Notifications in all its flavors.\\n\\n## Browser Extension\\n\\nThis is also a work in progress. The goal is to release an initial version of a Browser Extension that will allow end-users to easily set up their wallets to receive notifications (through a guided wizard). Once the wallet is configured, users will know when new notifications arrive and will be able to go to the dApp with 1-click.\\n\\n# Other Highlights\\n\\n- Our **Rockstar of Ethereum** latest episodes with [Nischal Shetty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiPGqggzoZ4) and [Anthony Sassano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCL4w7vnFfM&t=3s) are live!\\n- **Featured by:** [The Defiant: $PUSH farming tutorial](https://thedefiant.io/defiant-degens-how-to-farm-in-defis-first-protocol-for-push-notifications/), [dApp.com](https://www.dapp.com/article/3-utility-dapps-on-ethereum), [Interview by CryptoRand](https://cryptorandgroup.com/interview-with-epns/), [Report by Delphi Digital](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/push-vs-pull/), [Coinmonks](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-on-web-3-0-creates-more-earnings-opportunities-e8cc676ccc3b), [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/margin-trading-accounts-how-decentralized-notifications-increase-borrowing-power-e7p34qj), [dapp.com](https://www.dapp.com/article/3-utility-dapps-on-ethereum) and we are now on Zapper.fi!\\n- **Blog Posts**: Make sure to take a look at our [EPNS FAQ](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-faqs-21062505f479)\\n- **AMA:** [EPNS Community AMA](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-community-ama-recap-60cf5d4e555f), AMA Lovers Club, Crypto Talkz, [AMA with PlotX](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1397738325688029188?s=20), TheLAO Community AMA.\\n\\nThis month we want to leave you with one of our favorite and most liked tweet of the month: [Meet Frens of EPNS \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1395794479764836357?s=20)\\n\\nIt reflects in many ways how lucky and grateful we are to be in this amazing space at the right moment and at the right time.\\n\\nCheers!\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1395794479764836357&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"786\\" width=\\"1006\\" title=\\"Ethereum Push Notification Service | EPNS on Twitter: &quot;1/\ud83c\udf89Let\'s celebrate!
