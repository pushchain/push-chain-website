RabbitHole helps projects attract long-term contributors to their communities through on-chain resumes and rewards for skill-building on various project protocols. EPNS is delighted to jump into the rabbit hole and announce the launch of a pilot program to provide decentralized push notifications to support RabbitHole\u2019s development of long-term contributors to Web3 projects.\\n\\n### Developing the Web3 Jobs Economy With Push Notifications\\n\\nThe RabbitHole is a network built to help projects quickly bootstrap and build sustainable communities by attracting long-term contributors. RabbitHole is creating the on-chain resume for the future of work. By re-organizing how talent is attracted, the protocol is helping to reshape the future of work and how we engage, train, and retain talent. Through the gamification of learning, project treasuries distribute their tokens to incentivize contributors to participate in their network.\\n\\nThe protocol uses crypto incentives to help Web3 contributors build skills and on-chain credentials. For those seeking to develop new Web3 skills, users can participate in activities to build skills ranging from asset manager to NFT creator while participating in incentivized activities on major protocols like UnisSwap, Compound, OpenSea, and Gnosis. Meanwhile, participants develop on-chain credentials and a resume based on proven on-chain skills instead of a social media reputation or conventional resume.\\n\\nRabbitHole has developed a healthy network of leading DeFi protocols ready to assign tasks to new contributors and reward them for their participation. Ensuring all future contributors are informed of tasks and rewards, however, involves messages from multiple platforms yet no central messaging service exists. One essential element is missing, decentralized push notifications. The RabbitHole network users are highly dependent on notification services to communicate important information, including notifications on:\\n\\n- When rewards have been distributed\\n- New quests issued by protocols\\n- When a quest is starting and ending\\n\\nAs RabbitHole decentralizes into a DAO, users will also rely on push notifs to actively take part in the platform\u2019s self-governance process. Yet the lack of a decentralized push notification service, until now, means important notifications may be distributed to multiple places, such as email or a Telegram account. A push notification service would allow all platform users to receive and take timely action on important campaign notifications while still protecting data privacy as RabbitHole users interact with internal and external data sources.\\n\\n\\\\[\u201cRabbithole is delighted to see solutions come along that reduce information asymmetry. As we build out our infrastructure for quests EPNS is a valuable partner in helping onboard informed users into web3\u201d commented Tim Black, Product Manager at RabbitHole.\\\\]\\n\\n# The EPNS Solution\\n\\nThe EPNS decentralized push notification service sends timely notifications through a single source of communication, the investor\u2019s wallet. All notifications go directly to the user\u2019s wallet where they can take immediate action. EPNS is the first native, on-chain notification solution to stream all crucial time-sensitive information to a user\u2019s wallet. The partnership benefits to RabbitHole users include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send all data notifications directly to RabbitHole user wallets.\\n- The EPNS and RabbitHole teams will adapt the highly customizable EPNS protocol to meet the various push notification needs of the different contributors to projects.\\n- EPNS channels and users can customize their notification settings for different data notification requirements.\\n\\n# How EPNS Will Support RabbitHole\\n\\nUnder this pilot program, EPNS is building a dedicated channel for RabbitHole (see our [litepaper](https://whitepaper.epns.io) for definitions of channels, services, and more). RabbitHole users can subscribe to the RabbitHole channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets. Through collaboration with the RabbitHole team, we will gain insight into the push notification needs of users of community-building platforms and what they want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\nDecentralized notifications will provide real-time data to one wallet so all users can act in a timely manner. Users can be informed of all opportunities to match their skills to and take ownership in projects. Projects can use on-chain information to find future contributors and keep them in the information flow on quests and rewards with push notifs. Meanwhile, all users can continue to operate within the private, secure ecosystem of RabbitHole across different project protocols, without having to deal with integration pains across many different protocols.\\n\\n\\\\[\u201dThe timely delivery of notifications will be essential for talent to develop on-chain credentials for the future of work on Web3. Reliable notifications will ensure rewards and incentives are aligned with project protocol task achievements, and thus motivate sustainable contributor commitments to projects,\u201d commented Harsh Rajat, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service.\\\\]\\n\\nLooking forward, we foresee many new EPNS notification channels being introduced for RabbitHole in particular, and project campaigns in general. Push notifications will streamline the matching of contributors with Web3 projects based on the on-chain resume for the future of work. Projects will rely on notifs to incentivize users through rewards and built-in on-chain vesting.\\n\\nThus, we view decentralized push notifications as an important service that will support the building of long-term sustainable communities. Since RabbitHole is at the forefront of creating new ways to reshape the future of work for Web3, we expect our partnership to yield many new useful notification services and features for the decentralized lending market.\\n\\nThe long-term goal of the pilot program is to develop a notification system for future versions of RabbitHole. Project contributors \u2014 who can easily integrate the EPNS protocol into a wallet \u2014 will expect push notifications to be an integral service. Going forward, we also expect to work closely with RabbitHole users to create new messaging solutions to meet their evolving push notification needs.\\n\\nWe are pleased to be partnering with RabbitHole and anticipate EPNS push notifications becoming an indispensable tool in the development of Web3 communities.\\n\\n# About RabbitHole\\n\\nRabbitHole is a blockchain application interaction and activity incentive platform. Users can acquire XP, level up, and earn rewards for interacting with blockchain protocols. RabbitHole breaks down each decentralized application into gamified tasks so users can understand the main functions of the application while simultaneously bootstrapping the network.\\n\\n[Website](https://rabbithole.gg/) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/V7WMqbs) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rabbithole_gg) | [Mirror](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/)"}}')}}]);
