Simple. More than that though, the Store Kit enables any dApp store to list every Polygon and EVM dApp, set their own rules for monetization/distribution/curation/governance, brand it as they see fit, and more.\\n\\ndApp Store Kit stack solves the problem of how Web3 dApps are discovered on mobile devices. For the longest time this has been dominated by centralized stores like Apple and Google. But now, the dApp Store Kit provides an enhanced web3 native alternative that addresses the shortcomings of its web2 counterparts by making dApp store building composable, permissionless, and interoperable.\\n\\nYou can learn more about the dApp Store Kit and building with it [here](https://docs.dappstorekit.io/docs/start-here).\\n\\nA closer look at the dApp Store Kit stack \u2014 featuring Push as the communication solution.\\n\\n## How will Push be used?\\n\\nAs the chosen communications solution, all dApps building with dApp Store Kit will be able to leverage the full array of Push communication products to enhance their user engagement and experience. This includes Push Notifications, Push Chat, and the newly added Push Video!\\n\\nHere are some possible use cases for Push communication tools within the dApp store:\\n\\n1. <b>Push Notifications:</b> Dapp store creators can use Push notifications to alert users about new features, updates, or upcoming events. This can increase user engagement and keep users informed about the latest developments in the dApp store.\\n2. <b>Instant Chat:</b> Push Protocol\u2019s instant chat feature can be used by dApp store creators to provide customer support to users. This can help to resolve user issues and provide a more personalized experience for users.\\n3. <b>Video Chat:</b> Dapp store creators can use Push Protocol\u2019s video chat feature to provide personalized support to users. This can be particularly useful for complex issues that require visual explanations or demonstrations.\\n4. <b>Feedback Systems:</b> Push\u2019s communication tools can be used by dApp store creators to collect user reviews and ratings on the dApps they interact with. This can help to improve the quality of the dApps and provide valuable insights to dApp store creators.\\n5. <b>Social Features (Group Chat):</b> Push Protocol\u2019s group messaging can be used by dApp store creators to add social features to their dApps, such as chat rooms and forums. This can increase user engagement and create a sense of community within the dApp store.\\n\\nWhile these are just a few possible integrations, the full breadth of innovation is yet to be discovered as more dApp stores begin building using Push.\\n\\nWe are excited to be playing a critical role in providing our communication solutions, and hence giving access to an extensive range of new features.\\n\\n## Excited for the Future of Polygon x Push\\n\\nAll in all, we believe Push will be a game-changer for dApp store creators. Push Protocol will enable these creators to offer a more personalized experience while interacting with their users more efficiently and seamlessly. Together, this will enhance user engagement and the overall user experience for dApp store users.\\n\\nWe are excited about this new integration and the potential it brings to the world of decentralized applications. We look forward to collaborating with dApp store creators and their users to create a more personalized and seamless experience for everyone!\\n\\nLearn more about dApp Store Kit using Push on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol)\\n\\nLearn how to integrate Push into your dApp: [Push developer docs](https://comms.push.org/docs/)"}}')}}]);
