A month with many new Frens, substantial progress on the development front, and lots of awesome news for the project.\\n\\nTime to recap all the happenings during this month!\\n\\n![First Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n#### Meet our new Frens \ud83d\ude4c\\n\\n[Snapshot](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-partners-with-snapshot-to-deliver-notifications-to-improve-community-governance-5730559cb84b): Through this collaboration all token holder delegates for a specific governance project will receive notifications for new proposals. We will also be implementing a notification that will allow users to sign the proposals right form the notifications if they want to.\\n\\n[TrueFi](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/truefi-taking-defi-to-new-horizons-with-epns-cc4d230d550a): We launched this channel early in the month to notify users when new loans are available for voting, and to receive alerts when loans are coming due.\\n\\n[Oasis.app](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-notifications-arrive-at-defi-on-oasis-app-770ae7ed1b): With this collaboration Oasis.app users will receive notifications directly to their wallets, allowing them to take timely action on important DeFi notifications while still protecting data privacy.\\n\\n[B.Protocol](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-notifications-to-back-backstop-liquidity-platform-b-protocol-8a93c7b96f4): With B.Protocol already simplifying the lending and liquidation by connecting lending platforms, this collaboration aims to send timely notifications through a single source of communication directly to the user\u2019s wallet.\\n\\n[Ruler Protocol](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/ruler-protocol-innovating-the-defi-space-with-epns-3dc80c739097): This pilot program looks to deliver notifications to Ruler Protocol users when their loans are at least 24 hours before loan expiry, when minting rcTokens and rrTokens, when mint ratio goes significantly down, and more.\\n\\n[Boardroom](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-collaborates-with-boardroom-to-deliver-push-notifications-for-protocol-and-dao-governance-11bee8c8718e): The initial goal with this collaboration is to send notifications to Boardroom users about new proposals, voting, and brainstorming; as well as updates and results.\\n\\n[YAM Finance](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/bringing-power-of-web3notif-to-the-awesome-yam-community-95d8a39ed86c): We are currently working with the Yam.Finance team to create a channel to notify YAM users about new governance proposals. We will keep the community informed when the channel will go live.\\n\\n#### Community Activities\\n\\nWith new projects & teams coming on board with EPNS for Pilot Program Collaborations, we also want to make sure we give our communities the opportunity to learn more about what the integration means and what are the plans for the future.\\n\\nWith this in mind \u2014 we have been coordinating with our new Frens a series of cross AMAs and community calls. This ensures our communities grow strong together and have the chance to ask questions, and even participate in other activities such as our shared Meme Contests \ud83d\ude38.\\n\\nAMA transcripts are available through our [Medium](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/).\\n\\n### Development \ud83d\udea7\\n\\nEPNS keeps evolving into a much stronger protocol with a more complete feature set thanks to feedback from collaborators and the community. These are the main development activities that kept us busy this month.\\n\\n<b>Progressive Decentralized Governance</b>: this is one of our top priority items that we are aiming to align and have well-tested by the moment our protocol goes to Mainnet (end of Q3). Currently we are in the process of deploying and validating all governance tools and rules. The first step towards this Progressive Decentralized Governance will take place in August 2021\ud83d\udca3.\\n\\n<b>Chrome Browser Extension (Alpha) v0.1 is Live!</b>: While this is still an Alpha version, our team is currently working on improvements starting with better usability and UI, but will also be adding additional features to continue expanding its capabilities. Make sure to check out the release blog post and download the extension from here.\\n\\n<b>Improvements to the Mobile App</b>: switched to push-pull mechanism (push to your mobile and pull inside the app), also lazy loading of notifications available in the Android App. And we are currently working on adding the initial Channel Discovery features.\\n\\n<b>Plug & Play for Showrunners Framework</b>: providing more tooling and ease of use to the Developers community is a priority for us. This being said, we are putting efforts into improving the Showrunners framework to make the process of adding new channels much straightforward. The upcoming update on the showrunners framework makes it easier for developers to implement their customized channel logic in a plug and play manner.\\n\\n<b>Protocol optimizations and channel settings</b>: we continue working on developing furthermore the channel settings to offer more flexibility when setting up notifications. Another cool feature that we are working on right now is the implementation of gas-less transactions while subscribing and unsubscribing to a channel and sending notifications.\\n\\n<b>Ethereum PUSH Improvement Proposal (EPIP)</b>: We started working on adding the capability to sign right from a notification. For instance: voting on a proposal via YES/NO vote.\\n\\n<b>Mainnet and Push nodes</b>: another big bucket on our list. A lot of time this month was spent on feature validation and brainstorming. And while this is still a work in progress\u2026 someone mentioned something about staking nodes, and becoming blockchain agnostic \ud83e\udd10\\n\\nTo end this section with a cherry on top \ud83c\udf52 \u2014 we are excited to be working on other big and important protocol improvements that are coming soon, but they will be announced and discussed in its own blog post. Stay tuned!\\n\\nAlso, It\u2019s not a monthly review recap unless we have an alpha drop \ud83d\ude40\\n\\n![Second Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n#### EPNS Community Incentives\\n\\nThis month the community incentives come not only in the form of great continued APR percentages in our UNI-LP and PUSH pools. We still APR of 108% / 39% for LP / PUSH Staking.\\n\\n![Third Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-3.webp)\\n\\n<blockquote><i>Check it out and stake APR here: https://incentives.epns.io</i></blockquote>\\n\\nThe next biggest success among community incentives has been our Rockstars NFT, it contains custom unique art created by Indian artists and is dropped every week to the most creative community member, along with 2400 $Push.
