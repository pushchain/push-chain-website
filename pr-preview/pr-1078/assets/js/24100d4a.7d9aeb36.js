Complete the tasks mentioned and once you\u2019re done, you will gain the Push Builders\u2019 role for deeper access to our Guild-Gated Group Chat.\\n4. Click the dedicated URL that\u2019s now unlocked to join the chat. \\n5. Congratulations you just joined the Push Guild Gated Group Chat community. Don\u2019t forget to drop a gm and connect with fellow other group chat members.\\n\\n### What is Guild.xyz?\\n\\nGuild serves as the foundation for platform-agnostic access management to on-chain and off-chain communities. It enables the creation of portable memberships and social structures that encompass both on-chain and off-chain requirements, allowing for the development of distinct user journeys across various applications. \\n\\n[Here](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/build/conditional-rules-for-group/#guild-gated-group-example) are some examples of how you can create gated group chats for guilds at guild.xyz using GUILD type-in criteria.\\n\\nGot any questions?
