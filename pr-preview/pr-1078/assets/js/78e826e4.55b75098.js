The proposal aims to do this by changing the current \u201cgas-fee auction\u201d model (similar to Bitcoin). In the gas fee auction model, users bid for block space to include their transactions in the next block by increasing their gas limits and hence incentivizing miners to choose that transaction rather than one with lesser gas fees. The change that the EIP aims to push forward is to do away with the current model, and instead introduce a BASEFEE, which algorithmically adjusts itself based on the network congestion at that time. This means that if Ethereum is utilized by more than 50% then the BASEFEE increases and if the network is congested by less than 50% then the BASEFEE decreases. This would mean that gas prices would be set automatically by the network and users do not have to individually input their gas limit. With the introduction of BASEFEE, we would fundamentally get a \u201cmarket price\u201d for gas at the time. This also means that wallets no longer need to develop and estimate their own algorithms to show an estimate of the network congestion, but rather the BASEFEE itself shows the exact gas fee required to execute a transaction in the network."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"From an end-user perspective, users no longer need to manually input gas price, but rather just click \u201cSend Transaction\u201d if they are willing to pay the gas at the current market price."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["The proposal however has not done away with the fee auction model entirely as users who would like to get first in line can pay a TIP to the miner to incentivize them to add their transaction into the block first.

The EIP according to Eric Conner, aims to provide wallets and users a much-needed improvement to the user-experience of gas management.
