Welcome Eitan Katchka @Ekatch, Head of Ecosystem Development, B.Protocol to the EPNS Community! It is a pleasure to have you with us today for an exciting AMA session. \ud83e\udd29\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Hey all!\\n\\n**JAI**: @Ekatch, Before we start could you please introduce yourself and go over your background so everyone in here gets to know you better?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: So first of all thanks Jai for having me here on the EPNS channel for this AMA.\\n\\nMy name is Eitan Katchka and I\u2019m leading the ecosystem development at B.Protocol.\\n\\nBefore I fell down the rabbit hole of crypto, I was leading large scale community-based projects in Israel, where I live.\\n\\nI started my crypto journey in early 2014 as one of the co-founders of LaZooz, a carpooling dApp that we built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Vitalik was even one of our advisors back then. It was one of the first DAOs, even before the technology was there to support it. Was exciting times (and still is) but we were way too early.\\n\\nThen I was working with Toyota Research Institute on a PoC for a mobility service on Ethereum. It was early 2017 and that\u2019s when I first met Yaron Velner who is the founder of B.Protocol.\\n\\nThen Yaron went on to become Kyber Network\u2019s first CTO and we met again in mid-2020 when I joined B.Protocol to lead the ecosystem development of the project.\\n\\nAs for B.Protocol -\\n\\nB.Protocol is the Backstop liquidity protocol for DeFi, making liquidations more efficient. We will cover why this is crucial for scaling the DeFi ecosystem during this chat I believe.\\n\\nHope it\u2019s enough for now\u2026 ;)\\n\\n**JAI**: 2014 wow \ud83d\ude32\\n\\nImpressive stuff @Ekatch!!\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Just feeling like a dinosaur \u2026\\n\\nThis ecosystem develops so fast you know.\\n\\n**JAI**: Absolutely and I am sure, community is looking forward to it as well.\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: That\u2019s true and that\u2019s the beauty of it :D\\n\\n**JAI**: Please when you\u2019re done answering any question, you can say \u201c**DONE**\u201d @Ekatch.\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Sure.\\n\\n**JAI**: Let\u2019s move to the next segment of our AMA Session.\\n\\nI hope you\u2019re ready @Ekatch? I will be asking some questions. \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n> **Q1. Can you briefly tell our community about B.Protocol\u2019s mission and vision and why it was launched?**\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Sure.\\n\\nB.Protocol is the Backstop liquidity protocol for DeFi lending platforms.\\n\\nThe project\u2019s main goal is to offer a strong backstop for the DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nA backstop is a well-known solution in CeFi and Tradfi but is still unknown and un-used in DeFi, as we are all still early and the ecosystem is still being built. B.Protocol is doing the needed adjustments to provide a decentralized backstop which is suited for DeFi.\\n\\nA quick take on Backstop -\\n\\nHaving a backstop, e.g. dedicated liquidity for liquidations, enables smooth and immediate execution of liquidations of unsafe vaults and positions \u2014 those who crossed the collateralization ratio/factor as it was determined by the lending platform they are using. In simple words, it means that the funds a user has deposited as collateral are no longer sufficient to keep the debt he or she has taken. If these unsafe vaults/positions are not being liquidated, they cast a real threat for the platform to become insolvent \u2014 and in DeFi it means for the users who have lent the tokens to not be able to withdraw their funds.\\n\\n**JAI**: This sounds interesting \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Liquidations are one of the growth engines for DeFi. And a better liquidation system is one of the key missing elements for DeFi lending platforms and margin trading systems at the moment in DeFi. It will unleash better capital efficiency for their users \u2014 Higher leverage and better collateralization factors/ratios.\\n\\nCompared to CeFi systems like Binance, ByBit etc, which offer x100 to users capital, DeFi is still way behind with most platforms offer x3-x5 leverage (collateral ratios/factors of 130\u2013150%/66\u201375% depending on how the platforms calculate this).\\n\\n**JAI**: Great to know. \ud83d\udd25\\n\\nI completely agree with you!\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: So, B.Protocol v1 was launched in October 2020 and has mainnet integrations with MakerDAO and Compound.\\n\\nAnd yesterday we launched our first v2 integration with Liquity (LUSD), which offers passive APY on LUSD of about ~20% currently.\\n\\nOh, and last thing for now \u2014\\n\\nB.Protocol is governed by $BPRO token holders.\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n**JAI**: Amazing! Let\u2019s move onto the next Question.\\n\\n> **Q2. Can you please shed light on the major milestones B.Protocol has achieved so far and what can we expect from you guys in the future?**\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Sure.\\n\\nAs I mentioned we launched in Oct 2020 and have 3 integrations live on Ethereum mainnet \u2014 MakerDAO, Compound and Liquity.\\n\\nLiquity (LUSD/LQTY) is the first integration using B.Protocol v2 which enables liquidations via our novel Backstop AMM (B.AMM) design.\\n\\nUsers can try it here \u2014 [https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity](https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity)\\n\\nor read more about it here \u2014 [https://twitter.com/bprotocoleth/status/1422476042678251526?s=20](https://twitter.com/bprotocoleth/status/1422476042678251526?s=20)\\n\\n(I hope the links are ok here\u2026)\\n\\n[app.bprotocol.org](http://app.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\nB.Protocol\\n\\nThe decentralized backstop liquidity protocol.\\n\\nBesides that, since we launched we have integrated with a few aggregators and protocols such as \u2014\\n\\n**JAI**: Absolutely :D\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Zapper, Zerion, Furucombo, DeFi Saver, DeFi Pulse, DeFi Llama and DeBank. And have insurance covered by Nsure Network, and a Bug Bounty program run by Immunefi.\\n\\nYou can find most of it in our new Docs page \u2014 [https://docs.bprotocol.org/](https://docs.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\n[docs.bprotocol.org](http://docs.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\nIntro to B.Protocol\\n\\nDeFi\u2019 Backstop Liquidity Protocol\\n\\nPickle Finance has also integrated into our Liquity integration to offer compounding yields on LUSD and LQTY. You should check it out on their Jar page\u2026\\n\\nAnd just a few days ago our proposal to the Instadapp community has passed so users could soon use B.Protocol also with Instadapp\u2019s DSA.\\n\\n**AND now of course we also have EPNS coming!!!**\\n\\nSo the ecosystem around B.Protocol is growing.\\n\\nWe already have the next lending platform to integrate with our v2 \u2014 but this is still not officially announced so you will have to wait a bit more (but not too long\u2026 ;) )\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n**JAI**: That\u2019s great! Let\u2019s move onto the next question.\\n\\n> **Q3. Can you tell us a little bit about how your experience has been in building B.Protocol and what are the advantages B.Protocol has over similar projects?**\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Sure.\\n\\nIt\u2019s been intense as the ecosystem grows so rapidly and so many new projects and protocols are coming out all the time, but it\u2019s mainly lots of fun to take an active role in shaping this ecosystem and collaborating and integrating with so many other \u201cmoney lego\u201d protocols.\\n\\nThe main advantage of B.Protocol is making the DeFi ecosystem stronger and more resilient \u2014 and users who use B.Protocol make sure the lending platform they are using can handle liquidations also during sharp declines in the market.\\n\\nBut DeFi also comes with its incentives built in\u2026.\\n\\nIn B.Protocol v1 which is our integrations with Maker and Compound users actually share the liquidation proceeds made by the Backstop liquidators. As our v1 users are giving the protocol\u2019s liquidators a priority in the liquidation process, they get in return 35\u201350% of the liquidators proceeds as the liquidators don\u2019t need to compete with other liquidators and to pay high gas fees to miners (aka \u201cgas wars\u201d) in order to win the liquidation tx.\\n\\nIn v2, e.g. the integration with Liquity, users can get a PASSIVE 15\u201320% APY (currently) on their LUSD deposits in the Stability Pool. This is quite high for stablecoins.\\n\\nThis is possible thanks to the automated rebalancing of Liquity Stability Pool after liquidations are happening.\\n\\nUsers can also use Pickle.finance who has integrated with B.Protocol as well. In that case, users will also enjoy automated staking of LQTY, the reward token of Liquity, using the Pickle Jars for compounding yield.\\n\\nAlso, the community is currently discussing the next Liquidity Mining details, and some offers on the forum include rewards for new and existing users, as well as staking options for BPRO. So there is alot going on regarding advantages\u2026\\n\\nOne last thing maybe \u2014 For Maker and Compound the Import process to move from the lending platforms to B.Protocol is a **1-click process.**\\n\\nOnce you get connected with your MetaMask with the same account you are using for the original platform \u2014 an Import button pops up and all you need to do is to approve it on your MetaMask to get your funds move to be managed on B.Protocol (including any debt that you have of course).\\n\\nSo basically, if you are a user of Compound, Maker or Liquity, which are the platforms we support today, you have no real reason why NOT to use B.Protocol.\\n\\nDone \u2026\\n\\n**JAI**: \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: One clarification maybe \u2014 this is not relevant for Liquity. There users need to just withdraw their LUSD and deposit it via B.Protocol\\n\\nNow really done\u2026 ;)\\n\\n**JAI**: Thanks for the clarification! \u2708\ufe0f\\n\\nHere is the next Question :D\\n\\n> **Q4. EPNS is building a dedicated channel for B.Protocol which will allow your users to subscribe to the B.Protocol channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets.**\\n>\\n> **Can you tell us how you envision EPNS notifications playing an important role to help improve the experience for your current users, and attracting more new users?**\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: In the \u201cnon-crypto\u201d world we are so used to getting notified on our \u201cregular\u201d apps \u2014 Telegram, Whatsapp, Twitter, and definitely any finance application we are using. Even my bank app sends me notifications.\\n\\nBut in DeFi this is still a missing piece and it\u2019s a huge hurdle when on-boarding users, mainly those new to DeFi and crypto.\\n\\nI believe getting notifications from apps where you manage your money, definitely in such a volatile market such as DeFi, is a must. And it will improve the user experience significantly.\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what this collaboration is all about!!\\n\\nI think what users of lending platforms (which are our users as well) are mostly interested in, is the safety of their funds in the Vault. And one of the biggest fears for any lending platform user is to get liquidated\u2026\\n\\nSo the first notification service we will work on is letting users get notified whenever their funds are getting close to the liquidation threshold. This will enable them to manage their position in time and to try and save it.\\n\\nI believe this can bring a lot of added value to our users, and another great reason for some new users to move their funds to be managed on B.Protocol (besides all the other benefits\u2026)\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n**JAI**: EPNS \ud83e\udd1d B.Protocol\\n\\nLet\u2019s move onto the last Question of this segment.\\n\\n> **Q5. Can you tell us how you plan to further collaborate with EPNS and what is your long-term vision for our project which will help to make us stronger and better in the DeFi space?**\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: As we start with the above pilot use case, I believe more and more use cases will come up as for where notifications are mostly needed in our system.\\n\\nAnd of course our community of users will probably have the best ideas for that once they get to taste the benefits.\\n\\nAs B.Protocol gets integrated with more and more lending platforms, its notification system with EPNS might be used by users across DeFi, helping to share the vision of EPNS with more parts of the entire DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nI think there is a lot of potential for this collaboration\\n\\nDone!\\n\\n**JAI**: Brilliant, Thank you for your answers @Ekatch! We will now move to the last round which is a Live Q/A session.\\n\\nDear Community, get ready to shoot all your Questions! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n**I will UNMUTE the group soon and @Ekatch will pick and answer as many questions as possible but only participants with the BEST questions will be selected as winners at the end of AMA.**\\n\\nAre you all ready?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: GIF\\n\\n**JAI**: 1\u2026 GO!! GO!!\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Let\u2019s start with this one.\\n\\n**\u26e9**: Community support is one of the biggest aspects of a project\u2019s success. Most projects have programs that interact with their users. Do you have any special plans to attract and expand the community and improve the user experience?\\n\\n**JAI**: Our chat is on MUTE again and here you go, we have got the last set of Questions from community members.\\n\\nI now request @Ekatch to pick and answer the BEST Questions. This AMA is on fire. \ud83d\udd25\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: We are putting a lot of efforts on our community. Our Discord and forum are the places to get in touch with the team as well as with other B.Protocol members.\\n\\nThe team has no voting power in the governance \u2014 so B.Protocol is a real \u201cOwned by the gov\u201d project.\\n\\nWe are just building a Growth Squad which is built from members of the community.\\n\\n**KECIA HOUGHTON**: How revenue is generated to sustain the project, and what plans do you have to attract more users in the future?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: In v1 (currently Maker and Compound integrations) the revenues are coming from sharing the liquidation proceeds with the Backstop liquidators.\\n\\nIn v2 there are fees for the rebalancing of Liquity\u2019s Stability Pool and the DAO controls that switch to set the fees.\\n\\n**SUPERSTAR**: What are the steps to become a part of your community, and start getting revenues? Where do we buy, where do we sign up? This looks like an amazing project!\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: You can just head over to app.bprotocol.org and start using the protocol. If you are a Maker or Compound user you can just Import your existing account with 1-click as I mentioned.\\n\\nTo buy BPRO you can look at the regular DEXs \u2014 Uniswap v2 has some liquidity (though not alot\u2026)\\n\\n**NATHANIAL MIRANDA**: Q. I\u2019m a developer, and I\u2019m interested in contributing to B.Protocol alongside earning, Do you have any Bug Bounty to check for vulnerabilities ?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Yes there is!\\n\\nYou can head over to Immunefi for the details\\n\\n[https://immunefi.com/bounty/bprotocol/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/bprotocol/)\\n\\nImmunefi\\n\\nVProtocol Bug Bounties | Immunefi\\n\\nFind bugs and vulnerabilities on B.Protocol and get paid up to $100,000.\\n\\nWe also have some open tasks on Gitcoin from time to time.\\n\\nThe bug bounty has up to $100k in bounties (for critical ones\u2026)\\n\\n**LFC BOY**: Can $BPRO holders have the right to submit proposal and participate in the governance of the project? What kind of project decision can they vote on?\\n\\n@Ekatch\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: There is no limit currently for submitting proposals for vote.\\n\\nMost of the governance is held off-chain to enable more token holders to participate, via Snapshot.\\n\\nToken holders vote on Liquidity Mining rewards as on any allocation of funds from the DAO reserve. It will also vote on future fees etc.\\n\\n**LORI ESPINAL**: What is the utility of your native token B Protocol ? Also, What special features do you have or plan to implement that keeps you ahead of your competitors?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: BPRO is a purely Governance token. There are discussions in B.Protocol forum about future revenue sharing models and other mechanisms that can be put in place to add other uses to the token.\\n\\n**VOID**: Good projects always have an experienced team behind them. Can you tell us something about your team and their experience in the market?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: I\u2019ll take that as a compliment and as a question\u2026 ;)\\n\\nI have introduced myself at the beginning of the AMA so you can search for that\u2026\\n\\nThe founder and lead developer of B.Protocol, Yaron Velner, is the ex-CTO of Kyber Network which is one of the leading protocols in DeFi since 2017 (even before it was called DeFi\u2026).\\n\\nYaron holds a PhD in Computer Science from the Tel Aviv University in Israel and was also one of the co-designers of the WBTC protocol.\\n\\nSo I think you can definitely say B.Protocol is in good and experienced hands\u2026\\n\\n**LIVELY**: Can you explain how is your Tokenomics Distribution? How many tokens will be minted ? And how many tokens will be locked by the team??\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: It is all described in our Docs (docs.bprotocol.org)\\n\\nBut in short -\\n\\nduring the first 4 years since we launched (Oct 2020) 10m BPRO will be minted.\\n\\nThe 33% is going to the Devs. no VCs allocation were made.\\n\\n1m BPRO were distributed to early users of the protocol, who used it during the first 6 months.\\n\\n250k BPRO went to the first LM program that ran for 3 months.\\n\\nThe rest is in the hands of the DAO in the Reserve\\n\\nThis is taking some time to answer\u2026\\n\\nHold on\u2026\\n\\n2 more to go\u2026\\n\\n**JOHNNY METZ**: I would like to know if you\u2019ve completed any security audits? What measures have been taken to protect B.Protocol community from it?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Yes.\\n\\nB.Protocol was audited by Solidified both for its Maker and Compound integration.\\n\\nThe Liquity integration was also audited by a separate group of auditors. I can share links later but again \u2014 it is all in the Docs (docs.bprotocol.org)\\n\\nLAST ONE\u2026.\\n\\n**MURDOCK**: From where you get the project name? What does it means to you? And why did you choose this name for your project? What is your mission and vision to build this project? What do you want to achieve in the future????\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: A good clarification is in place!\\n\\nB. stands for Backstop.\\n\\nSo its Backstop Protocol\\n\\nSome think we should have sticked with Backstop\u2026 but B.Protocol became the name. At least until we rebrand like all the big projects do\u2026 ;)\\n\\nAs for the vision and future plans I have shared in the AMA so you can have a look above\u2026\\n\\nThanks everyone for an amazing AMA!!!\\n\\n**JAI**: @Ekatch can you drop Social Media Channel Links of B.Protocol\\n\\nThat would be awesome!\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**:\\n\\nHere is where you can find everything about B.Protocol\\n\\nWebsite \u2014 [https://www.bprotocol.org/](https://www.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\nDiscord \u2014 [https://discord.com/invite/bJ4guuw](https://discord.com/invite/bJ4guuw)\\n\\nTwitter \u2014 [https://twitter.com/bprotocoleth](https://twitter.com/bprotocoleth)\\n\\nReddit \u2014 [https://www.reddit.com/r/bprotocol/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bprotocol/)\\n\\nForum \u2014 [https://forum.bprotocol.org/](https://forum.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\nDocs \u2014 [https://docs.bprotocol.org/](https://docs.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\nLatest Liquity integration \u2014 [https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity](https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity)\\n\\n**JAI**: Thank you for your insightful answers, @Ekatch.
