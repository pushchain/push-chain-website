We reached new milestones and launched exciting initiatives. We sent out more than **6 Million** notifications in April reaching a cumulative **74 Million notifications** since the launch and 177K subscribers. The Push journey continues to gain momentum. Here\u2019s a recap of what happened:\\n\\n## Product Updates:\\n\\nWe\'ve made significant strides in our development journey. We successfully deployed our [React Native SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/react-native-sdk) on NPM, simplifying the process for developers to access it. We\'ve also rolled out improved notification settings on app stores, allowing for a more customized user experience.\\n\\nIn our SDK, we introduced a new **ChatWidget** component and broadened our blockchain support to include **Berachain** and **Polygon Amoy**.\\n\\nOur website has been enhanced with a fresh landing page for the [Billion Reasons to Build (BRB) Bootcamp](https://push.org/bootcamp/), and we\'ve enhanced the footer for smoother navigation.\\n\\nWe\'re steadily advancing with new blockchain integrations that are currently under review. We\'ve streamlined our channel addition process by separating it from IPFS, among other improvements. We\'re in the process of developing support for SCW wallets on our Push SDK.\\n\\nOur research on the Cross Chain Feature, which enables Ethereum and Layer 2 requests, has been completed and its development is underway. The **Push Governance** contract has been redesigned to align with the updated OpenZeppelin governance structure. We\'ve managed to reduce the Smart Contract size by 30% and optimize gas fees for key functions like channel creation.\\n\\n## Partnership Updates\\n\\nWe\'re thrilled to announce new partnerships with amazing projects including [Vurse](https://twitter.com/vurse_official/status/1782414484700533169), [Rivo](https://www.rivo.xyz/), [Estate Protocol](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1778091601597960326), and [Pistachio Fi](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1780266671783194989) to integrate notifications and messaging. We also partnered with [Dora Hacks](https://twitter.com/DoraHacks/status/1783170660346544309) for the Data Economy Hackathon.\\n\\n## Billion Reasons to Build (BRB):\\n\\n![Banner for Billion Reasons to Build](./image1.webp)\\n\\nWe took a big step forward in our [BRB journey](https://push.org/brb/) by launching the BRB Bootcamp. This [6-week virtual program](https://github.com/orgs/push-protocol/discussions/52) is designed to jumpstart your journey as a Web3 builder. You can register [here](https://zv9atndluia.typeform.com/to/ToIpDLT2?typeform-source=push.org) (limited seats available).\\n\\n## Community Engagement:\\n\\nApril was all about building a strong and vibrant community. We hosted a Push Video Contest asking the community to share their experience with Push Protocol. Rewarded the ultra-rare first **\u201cPush Chad\\"** role. We held an **AMA** with [Berachain](https://www.berachain.com/) - a modular EVM-compatible L1 blockchain. Partnered with [cookie3.com](http://cookie3.com/) for **\\"The Great Bake Off\\"** campaign.\\n\\n## Ecosystem Highlights:\\n\\nIn April 2024, we featured [ENS Domains](https://ens.domains/), [Cryptocurrency Jobs](https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/), [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), and [BTC Tracker](https://app.push.org/channels/0x03EAAAa48ea78d1E66eA3458364d553AD981871E) as the #PushChannelOfTheWeek.\\n\\nOur team was invited to speak at various side events during [Token2049](https://www.token2049.com/), including Tribe Connect by [Buidlers Tribe](https://buidl.so/), Block Vision by [Nordek](https://www.nordek.io/), Hadron Founders Club by [Hadron Founders Club](https://hadronfc.com/) & [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), DataCon 2024 by [dapplooker](https://dapplooker.com/), DeSoc Unleashed Dubai Edition by [Mask Network](https://mask.io/) & [Tako Protocol](https://tako.so/), and Builder Day Dubai by [Consensys](https://consensys.io/).\\n\\n## DAO Updates:\\n\\nWe had the pleasure of hosting [FactorDAO](https://twitter.com/FactorDAO) for an exclusive X space for **DAO to DAO Talk**. In our ambassador program, we welcomed two new members for Push Protocol in the Spanish Ambassadors community and opened up five additional spots for the Push Protocol Indian Ambassadors community. We\'ve also submitted a proposal \\"[Billion Reasons to Build, Bangkok](https://forum.devcon.org/t/billion-reasons-to-build-bangkok-sea-web3-builders/3482?u=richa_joshi)\\" to host a builder-centric event at [Devcon 2024](https://devcon.org/en/), aimed at celebrating, engaging, and supporting developers.\\n\\nIn other exciting news, we managed to pass three key votes for the BD subDAO, Grants subDAO, and the DAO Council. This significant achievement has paved the way for the launch of our subDAOs on the first of June. With this, we are thrilled to introduce the community-led Push Grants V3. This new initiative opens up a world of opportunities for grantees to contribute and vote, marking an exciting new phase for Push Grants V3. Our Push DAO V2 Proposal caught the attention of the [Messari](https://messari.io/) and was featured there. Check out the [Push Governance Forum](https://gov.push.org/) to stay updated with all the activities in **PushDAO**.\\n\\nStay tuned for more updates as we continue to push the boundaries of the Web3 ecosystem!"}}')}}]);
