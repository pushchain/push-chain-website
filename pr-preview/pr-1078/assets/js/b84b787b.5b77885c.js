I was lucky to judge EPNS at an ETHGlobal hackathon where I met Harsh and Richa and was impressed with their vision and execution and am excited to be on board.\u201d \u2014 Mariano Conti\\n\\n\u201cWe are truly grateful and happy to get them and embark on our next leg of the journey for building the world\u2019s first decentralized notification protocol\u201d \u2014 [Harsh Rajat](https://twitter.com/harshrajat) (Founder, EPNS)\\n\\nThese investors will help us ramp up efforts for making decentralized notifications a reality soon and to connect with projects and tweak the vision to better suit the entire ecosystem. We are deeply humbled and grateful for the support from our investors. Most of them are already our mentors and provide invaluable guidance, networking and deep practical knowledge of the ecosystem.\\n\\n# Genesis of \u201cMissing Piece of Web3 Infrastructure\u201d\\n\\nPrevious technology often follows a pattern which can be observed to find ways to address the pain points in upcoming technology. As Mark Twain puts it, History doesn\u2019t repeat itself but often rhymes. We can learn a great deal from observing and, of course, being at the right place at the right time.\\n\\nThe genesis of the idea for EPNS occurred when we sat down to observe what, if any, pain points still existed among blockchain apps (dApps / smart contracts / services) that we could solve. We were quick to realize that something felt a bit odd, but took some time to realize that Web3 tech behaved a lot like the early days of the internet.\\n\\nThink 2004ish when GMail was launched and changed inboxes forever. At that point of time, the internet was still growing and the services offered behaved exactly the same way they do in Web3 today. For instance, you as a user were expected to log in to your mailbox to check email, reply to friends / work and then come back to it later and rinse and repeat. If you were the trendy one back in those days then maybe you went to Myspace and Orkut as well! But no matter the service, you were always going back to check on your actions.\\n\\n[This drastically changed when Apple came up with notifications in 2010](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/in-2009-push-notifications-changed-web2-0-in-2020-epns-is-bringing-them-to-web3-0-4ac506a0c9de) (though Google might have invented them). All of a sudden, services began to reach out to users whenever an action was required from their end. It increased engagement rate 7x and massively improved user experience. Notifications have been so engraved into our lives now that we hardly realize most of our online actions are caused by them; think about it, whatsapp, facetime, emails, payments, games all inform you now. You don\u2019t go back to them to see if something has happened.\\n\\nContrast this experience with any dApps, smart contracts or services you interact with on Web3. There\u2019s no way to inform users (wallet addresses) any time an important event occurs. Instead, the user is assumed to go back to the service time and time again to check their activity.\\n\\nFor instance, Liquidation on AAVE, Compound or any DeFi, DAO Governance proposal (Yam!), or ENS / dEx orders. Each of these are a reality right now but no solution exists to address them and the problem will only worsen as more services come to Web3.\\n\\nThis was the moment that we realized that this stone age era of communication in blockchain needs to go. You are not foreclosed by your bank without proper notices that reach you, but DeFi \u2014 while enabling awesome use cases \u2014 does that to you. And we wanted to fix that.\\n\\n# Our Vision\\n\\nWeb3 users are wallet addresses and Web3 services are serverless. The entry point to any dApp starts with connecting your crypto wallet and thus it makes sense to enable notifications to wallets as that is at the core of the entire Web3 experience.\\n\\nWe envision a world of Web2 where notifications are delivered to whatever platform the user is using and can come from any blockchain apps that want to notify. The wallet should be able to earn part of the revenue as well, as they essentially are a part of the notifications experience and everything needs to be decentralized to ensure that things happen in a transparent, platform agnostic and of course DeFi incentivized way. And perhaps most importantly, users need to have complete control to ensure they are not inundated with unwanted, unhelpful, or overwhelming notifications.\\n\\nThe very next steps will be to build some of the remaining features of the protocol MVP and move towards audit and then come on Mainnet!\\n\\n# EPNS Advisors\\n\\nWe are really grateful for the guidance and support (not to mention the love) we have been given by our Advisors and we wouldn\'t have been here without them.
