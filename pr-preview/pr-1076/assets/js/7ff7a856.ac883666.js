We\u2019ll be using AAVE protocol to generate [EPNS](https://epns.io/) Channel stakes on Mainnet.\\n\\nAAVE is a critical component of EPNS Game Theory, incentivizing users along with delivering notifications. When a Channel (services \u2014 dapps, SCs) stake on the EPNS protocol, the stake goes to a combined stake pool of Channels and starts earning interest using AAVE. This interest is then distributed to all the subscribers (wallet addresses) of that service in a weighted manner preferring the earliest subscriber more than the later ones. Refer to the [EPNS Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.epns.io/).\\n\\nThe incentive part of the EPNS protocol was ideated and built at [ETHGlobal](https://medium.com/u/3d1733b8e86a?source=post_page-----cc618dd48915--------------------------------) HackMoney 2020. We are really grateful to the amazing AAVE team Stani Kulechov, Marc Billy Zeller, David Truong, Ernesto Boado for mentoring and guiding us during HackMoney.\\n\\n## Join us!\\n\\nBecome part of our buzzing community!
