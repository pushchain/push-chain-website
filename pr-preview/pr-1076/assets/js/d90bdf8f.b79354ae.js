We created a very extensive and comprehensive documentation for developers, services, and end users. Additionally, we prepared a youtube playlist covering the many aspects of EPNS and its usage \u2014 [the EPNS 101 series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyWTqFLqKt9a2WVohtCzzsdo6GVpu1uTw). Make sure to check it out!\\n\\nMany other things worked this month are the result of feedback from the community and our collaborations, other things are us following our roadmap to ensure we achieve all our goals for this 2022.
