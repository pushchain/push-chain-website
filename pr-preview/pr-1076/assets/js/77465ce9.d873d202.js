It has become a powerful tool for communication and coordination not just in Web2, but in Web3 as well. Recently on Twitter, people developed and created PleasrDAO in 2 days with 310 ETH for the sole purpose of buying an NFT.\\n\\nIt is no secret that our Web3 world heavily relies on social media to pass relevant information. The Mask Network is leveraging social media to onboard more people to the crypto ecosystem, including being able to purchase and swap cryptocurrencies without ever having to leave Twitter or Facebook.\\n\\nIn addition to supporting DeFi, the Mask Network team strongly believes in democratizing the internet. With individual data privacy a major concern for social media users, Mask Network offers encrypted messages which only the intended user can decrypt. On this journey of Mask Network to redefine the future of the internet, we are super excited to collaborate with them to run our pilot program.\\n\\nIn February 2021, the Mask Network had released their native governance token, $MASK. While the tool they are building on top of Web2 gives individuals the benefits of Web3, it is a cumbersome process for the team to reach out to their targeted users through the same media. This is where EPNS fits in. As a protocol, we are trying to bridge the gap between users and services by adding a communication layer.\\n\\nOur focus during this pilot program will be on creating a channel for Mask Network that will allow the team to communicate with their targeted wallet addresses through a decentralized notification service facilitated by EPNS protocol. Notifications can be customized based on requirements and could be used to let users know when a buy/sell/swap order of their cryptocurrencies gets confirmed, when an NFT gets minted, when there is a new governance proposal, and more.\\n\\nWith this new way of adding Web3 features on top of social media, we anticipate few trends that will increase the need for decentralized notifications.\\n\\n1.  More exciting projects built on top of a wider range of social media networks would evolve.\\n2.  More innovation along various use cases of DeFi tools on top of various internet platforms.\\n3.  With massive adoption of these tools over various platforms on the internet, online shopping sites might also lean towards supporting cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nWe believe in providing a strong decentralized communication channel for a seamless privacy-protected experience through EPNS. By closely working with the team of Mask Network, we hope to refine EPNS protocol to meet the expectations of users and services.\\n\\n# About Ethereum Push Notification Service\\n\\nEPNS is a decentralized notification protocol that enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications. Using the protocol, any dApp, service or smart contract can send notifications to users in a platform agnostic fashion (mobile, tablet, web, user wallets, etc). The DeFi aspect of the protocol ensures that the user receives notifications and also earns from them.\\n\\nStay in touch!
