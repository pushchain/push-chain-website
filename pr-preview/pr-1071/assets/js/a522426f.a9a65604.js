Hackathon that concluded on December 17th, 2020.\\n\\nEPNS posted three bounties for the event:\\n\\n- [EPNS Front-End SDK](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-protocol/1/) (1500 DAI)\\n- [dApp Front-End mechanism to fetch data](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-protocol/3/) (2000 DAI)\\n- [Documentation for our Protocol](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-protocol/2/) (400 DAI)\\n\\n## The Front-End SDK meets the dApp mechanism to fetch data\\n\\n![First Image of EPNS Gitcoin #GR8 Hack \ud83c\udfd7 \ufe0fBounties Winner Announcement!](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nTwo bounties with two different goals:\\n\\n- The SDK bounty aims to facilitates integrating EPNS notifications into other dApps.\\n- The dApp mechanism to fetch data was more open to the developer(s) creativity, and aims to create a mechanism to retrieve notifications data in a structured and organized fashion. Which will greatly help towards producing a richer User Experience.\\n\\nIt was truly a pleasant surprise running into a submission that combines both bounties in a nice elegant fashion.\\n\\nThe winner of the two bounties is Gitcoin user [**VBStreetz**](https://gitcoin.co/vbstreetz)! \ud83c\udfc6 Congratulations and many thanks for such an outstanding job! We are currently working to merge this improvement.\\n\\nYou can try the [**demo here**](https://epns-staging.surge.sh/#/), or you can [**see it in action here**](https://vimeo.com/492196309/bdb971e572).\\n\\nWhile for the documentation bounty we didn\u2019t receive any formal submission, we encourage those of you who were interested \u2014 not only in the bounty but in EPNS in general \u2014 to get in touch with us an express your interest in collaborating with the project and help with the documentation. We will be more than happy to work together with you.\\n\\n# Thank you!\\n\\nWe would like to thank the awesome Gitcoin team (Big shout out to Scott, Connor, Joe) and everyone who participated in the hackathon. We look forward to collaborating with the Gitcoin community in future.\\n\\nLets continue #buidling cool stuff together and make a memorable 2021!"}}')}}]);
