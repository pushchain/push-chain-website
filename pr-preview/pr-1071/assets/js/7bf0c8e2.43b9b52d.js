Shortly after, we announced our [**partnership with Gitcoin**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1388131533735661573?s=20).\\n\\nThe partnership builds on the EPNS platform to allow notifications for the grant process, better connecting grantees to grantors.\\n\\nThis journey with Gitcoin led us to believe that we need to give back to the community that gave us so much, thus we really believed that paying it forward would be the best approach to give back to the community and decided to become the grantors of Gitcoin Grants Round **11 and 12**, where we sponsored **$50K** each round.\\n\\n**The latest Gitcoin Grants Round (Grants Round 13) kicked off on March 9th and will run through till March 24th**, and we are thrilled to be sponsoring yet another round, staying true to our grantees to grantors journey with Gitcoin.\\n\\n**How to apply for Gitcoin Grants?**\\n\\nIf you\u2019re building an open-source project, you could consider creating a grant to get funded by the community\\n\\n(P.S we would love to see you build something on EPNS \ud83d\ude09 ).\\n\\nGrants are only eligible to receive contributions after approval from the Gitcoin team.

We believe the community that backed us during our original grant back in Round 7, helped us grow to become who we are today, and we are glad to help and push other projects to grow the same.\\n\\nLet us build the future of web3 together, by paying it forward in an open and transparent way.\\n\\n\u2014\\n\\nHave you contributed to your favourite projects on Gitcoin Grants?
