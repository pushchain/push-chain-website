It is a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain built to allow developers to create universal apps and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s, and L3s enabling transactions from any chain - any app and any user.\\n\\n[Explore more about Push Chain here](https://push.org/)\\n\\n\\n## Bringing Fuse to Push Chain\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc65\xa0What does this mean for Fuse and Push Chain Users?\\n\\n**Borderless On-chain Business Txns**\\n\\nEnabling on-chain transactions, whether monetary or non-monetary - between businesses from entirely different blockchain ecosystems is a complex process, burdened by communication overhead, intricate bridging, and settlement challenges.\\n\\nPush Chain abstracts this burden away by unifying the settlements of any EVM and non-evm chains - providing Fuse users a super smooth and quick any-chain transaction experience without leaving the Fuse ethos.\\n\\n\\n**Unified Invoicing and Accounting**\\n\\nEnterprise apps on Fuse Chain can leverage Push Chain\u2019s universal identity solution, Push ID, to track and monitor spending and invoicing across addresses in a unified manner by linking them to Push ID.\\n\\n[Learn more about Push Chain\u2019s Innovations here](https://push.org/blog/innovations-by-push-chain/).\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc77\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\xa0What does this mean for builders?\\n\\n**Build Universally Abstracted Enterprise Apps**\\n\\nWith shared settlement capabilities of Push Chain  - devs can build enterprise apps with powerful chain, fee and wallet abstraction capabilities - allowing transactions from any chain with near instant finality.\\n\\n**Attract Universal Users**\\n\\nFuse apps deployed on Push Chain can seamlessly open their doors to users from other EVM, and non-EVM chains and foster true shared experiences with Push Chain\u2019s key innovations like - Shared State and Universal Smart Contracts.\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd13\xa0Usecase unlock\\n\\n**Universal Growth Tools**\\n\\nTools like [Midle](https://midle.io/) can leverage Push Chain to create comprehensive growth campaigns combining both on-chain and off-chain tasks, verifiable and accessible from any blockchain. Users can participate using their preferred wallets, complete tasks on any chain, and receive instant rewards on their chosen network.\\n\\n\\n**Universal B2B / B2C Threat Monitoring Services**\\n\\nSecurity monitoring solutions like [Ironblocks](https://www.ironblocks.com/) and utilize Push Chain for powering a universal security monitoring system that protects assets and transactions across all blockchain ecosystems simultaneously. For instance, if a security threat is detected for a cross-chain wallet on one chain, the system could instantly broadcast alerts and implement protective measures across all connected chains creating a unified security perimeter where threats are identified, tracked, and mitigated instantly.\\n\\n**Universal AI Trading Agents**\\n\\nAI agents can analyse and execute trades across both Fuse and other chains unifying liquidity for optimal arbitrage, yield and trading strategies.\\n\\n\\n## \ud83c\udf0c\xa0What does this mean for Web3?\\n\\n**Unifying experiences by bringing users together.**\\n\\nPush Chain isn\u2019t here to replace networks or compete with any; instead, it aims to eliminate the fragmented state of Web3 by unifying settlement across all chains under one universal shared state, unlocking a seamless, interconnected Web3 experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n1.
