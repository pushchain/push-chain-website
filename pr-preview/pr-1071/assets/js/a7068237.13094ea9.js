Leveraging the power of Arbitrum\'s scalable, fast, and secure Layer 2 solutions, Push notifications enable real-time alerts for various blockchain activities such as transaction confirmations, governance proposals, DeFi updates, and NFT drops.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what else is there to know and get excited about? Let\u2019s dive in.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Arbitrum x Push Protocol - Revolutionizing Decentralized Interaction \\r\\n\\r\\nSince our mainnet launch in January 2022, Push has emerged as the go-to communication layer for over 700+ of the world\'s leading dApps on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), [BNB Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/), [Polygon zkEVM](https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm), [Linea](https://linea.build/) and other blockchains.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, we\u2019re expanding our privacy-centric communication product suite to the leading Layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum, Arbitrum. With over [45.1% of the Ethereum Layer-2](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/ethereum-l2-arbitrum-base/#:~:text=It%20boasts%20a%20market%20share,a%20TVL%20of%20%247.93b.) market share and a TVL of over $15.42 Billion \u2013 Arbitrum provides some of the best tools for building scalable dApps on Ethereum and has an incredibly active user-base (with 971M in total DeFi transactions across 1.6M active wallets as of June 2024).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs such, what makes this integration so exciting is the potential utility and enhancement possibilities. Leveraging Push Notifications, Chat, and Video, we look forward to integrating with leading Arbitrum dApps to enhance how dApps and users interact.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best part of our integration: multi-chain communication. As we continue to expand our blockchain integrations, we open the door to better interoperability between users on different chains. This enhanced user-experience means fewer compromises in the way of interaction and engagement for users, and as a result, better adoption and user-stickiness. All this utility is driven by the communication infrastructure of Push Protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Push x Arbitrum: What to Expect\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the arrival of Push Protocol communication protocol, dApps and protocols on Arbitrum can begin building with web3-native notifications, chat, video, and spaces functionality. Here\u2019s what you can build with each of these communication tools:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. \ud83d\udd14<b>Push Notifications</b>: Send and receive updates from your favorite Arbitrum dApps directly into your wallet \u2013 enabling DeFi, News, NFT projects to share updates and alerts faster.\\r\\n2. \ud83d\udcac<b>Push Chat + Group Chat</b>: Enable wallet-to-wallet and wallet-to-dApp instant chat functionality \u2013 opening the door to social media platforms, customer service tools, and other social interaction enhancements.\\r\\n3. \ud83d\udcf9<b>Push Video and Space</b>: Face-to-face video chat directly on blockchain \u2013 introducing all-new interactivity on social dApps and live-streaming.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcitingly, we\u2019ve deployed the most up to date smart contracts of Push, [Push V2](https://push.org/blog/push-v2-is-live-new-rewards-utility-and-functionality/), on Arbitrum. Carrying over all the developments we\u2019ve launched so far, Customized Profiles, settings for [Notification Channels](https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings/), and notification integration with [MetaMask](https://push.org/blog/deep-dive-into-push-snaps-features-and-getting-started-all-the-technical-specifications-and-getting-started-tips-you-need/).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor builders \u2013 all new ways to engage your users and provide a stickier, more personalized user-experience are here. Get started here: https://comms.push.org/docs/\\r\\n\\r\\nFor users \u2013 can start receiving native Arbitrum notifications https://app.push.org/channels\\r\\n\\r\\n### Looking Ahead\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we spread our wings into the Arbitrum ecosystem, we stay true to our commitment to building the leading multi-chain communication protocol of web3. We\u2019ll be showcasing our launch partners in the coming days, stay tuned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the Arbitrum community and Push Protocol fam, expect many integrations to come.\\r\\n\\r\\n#PoweredbyPush"}}')}}]);
