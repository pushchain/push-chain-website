We are happy to announce our AMA session with EPNS! Welcome to Satoshi Club\ud83d\ude00\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:** Hello everyone! \ud83d\udc4b  \\nAnother AMA in Satoshi club! And our guests today \u2014 @harshr @RJlwl! Welcome!  \\nHello guys! \ud83d\ude03\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS**:  \\nThanks, @Cool_as_Ice Really excited to be here!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club**:  \\nHello, Harsh\ud83d\udc4f happy to see you here \ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club**:  \\nGood to have you here \ud83d\ude03How are you doing?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nHey Legendary Satoshi Community & @Cool_as_Ice, great to be here \ud83d\udc4b\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nHello! welcome! \ud83e\udd73\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nHello, Risha! Welcome to Satoshi Club \ud83d\udc4f\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nHey @madamlobster doing great, hope you all are having an awesome weekend as well.\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nDo you guys ready to begin our AMA?\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nGuys, could you please introduce yourself and tell us how did you start with EPNS?\ud83d\ude00\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nThanks! Really feels awesome to be here\u2026 Hey awesome Satoshis ;). I am Harsh, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service. Some background about me, I love dabbling in all things tech; and have been fortunate enough to have the support from the awesome Ethereum and blockchain community to have been given the chance to create/change the communication layer for Ethereum and Web3 which we like to call as The missing piece of web3.\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nSure! I am the co-founder of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS). I wear multiple hats at EPNS though am focused on mostly Marketing and Product. Before EPNS, I worked with companies like Deloitte, Wipro, etc., and have close to 12 years of techno-functional experience in various aspects of product management, design, and development across multiple facets of the product lifecycle.\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nA bit about our journey:\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nNice background! Sure it will help EPNS a lot\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n\ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nWe have had an awesome journey! We identified this pain point, ie: lack of communication in Web3 in January, Ideation and loads of research took a couple of months after which we took the idea to Ethereum Foundation, there we were lucky to be guided to EthGlobal HackMoney, after which we got selected and mentored by IDEO in their product validation day (PVD) and then got selected in Gitcoin Kernel accelerator/incubator, which is one of the most prestigious accelerators in our space. We are loving this roller coaster ride!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nYes! And I see that your coaster ride is really successful \ud83d\ude00\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nAwesome journey indeed! \ud83d\ude01\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nAlso, really happy and grateful to share that we recently completed our seed round and were honored to get backing from notable web3 leaders including Balaji Srinivasan (Fmr CTO of Coinbase, General Partner at a16z. Cofounder of Earn, Counsyl, Teleport), Kenneth Ng (Ethereum Foundation), Scott Moore (Co-founder, Gitcoin), Mariano Conti (Fmr Head of Smart Contracts, MakerDAO), Anthony Sassano (EthHub / TheDailyGwei), DeFiDad (COO, Zapper), Ravindra (Frontier Wallet), Preethi Kasireddy (Fmr Partner at a16z), Auryn Macmillan (Gnosis), TheLAO, MetaCartel VC and several more awesome peeps!\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nTo learn more about our investors please visit: [https://epns.io/](https://epns.io/)\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nA lot of familiar and famous names \ud83d\udc4f\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\n\ud83d\ude4c\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nCongrats on this achievement \ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\n\ud83d\ude03\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nYou have an amazing intro, guys!\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nThank you dear @madamlobster.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nThank you and are you ready to start with the questions from our community?\ud83d\ude00 We want to know more about EPNS\ud83d\ude80\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nSure! let\u2019s do this.\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nQ1 from Telegram user @jobel4  \\nAs the trademark or tagline of EPNS goes \u201d Subscribe, notify and earn.\u201d. Firstly, is the subscription of EPNS is free or need to pay? If need to pay, what is the medium of payment? Can I also unsubscribe? Secondly, How can I get notified, is that thru email, SMS or multimedia messaging? Lastly, as a curiosity how can I earn in your platform if the service you have is giving notification? Thank you.\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nAwesome question!\\n\\nEPNS is free or needs to pay?  \\nSubscribing is a one-time process that is always free!! with the exception of users paying gas for opt-in, which can in many instances be taken care of by services frontend (or through us) via meta transaction.\\n\\nWhen it comes to users, all they have to do is pay the gas fees which can vary depending on if it\u2019s done through L1 or L2. The medium of payment is only in relation to gas and hence ETH. For unsubscribe, A communication protocol needs to have users in full control and hence the user can always unsubscribe with the service having no control over it.\\n\\nHow do you get notified?  \\nSince we abstracted sending notification and receiving part, in essence, notifications can be delivered to any platform including the ones you mentioned! But for now, we want to focus on pseudo-anonymous web3 notifications which mean you are notified on your wallet address. The design is simple, subscribe to a service you want to receive notifications from, connect your public wallet address to either our mobile app, dApp, or extension (coming soon) and that\u2019s it! Let the notifs will come to you.\\n\\nIn the future, we envision EPNS protocol to also be integrated among your favorite crypto wallets which will mean that whatever web3 entry software you use will show these notifs to you!\\n\\nThe Earn part is our favorite! Since we are a decentralized notification protocol, the services before they can send out notifs to their subscribers are required to activate themselves, which we call it creating a channel. For this, they are required to stake DAI (50 or higher) to the protocol. This DAI is then lending out via the protocol to AAVE and in turn, starts generating interest which is distributed among the subscribers of that channel in a weighted manner towards early subscribers.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nDo you have guides on how to use your services?\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nCan we already use your service? on which platforms it\u2019s available?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nSure, we are coming out with our How-to-Guide soon. For now, users can reach us on our telegram group [https://t.me/epnsproject](https://t.me/epnsproject) and we can guide them on each step on how to set it up \ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\n\\\\[In reply to Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first\\\\]  \\nGreat! I already downloaded your app, but I think I will need help\ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes, While we are on Ropsten, notifications are live and working.\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nHaha, sure! Here to help.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\n\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nNice! I need to try this \ud83d\udc4c\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nThank you for your answers! ready for the next question?\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nWe need to try\ud83d\ude09 sure, it will be very useful!\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes.\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\n**\ud83d\udcaf\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:  \\n**Awesome! Let\u2019s do this!\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nQ2 from Telegram user @Highpee  \\nNotification providers can become annoying sometimes with the way and rate at which they send unsolicited spam notification to users. As a Push Notification Service, how does EPNS ensures that notifications are not unnecessary overbearing but are specifically targetted to add value to the user? Do you have a content filtering and abstraction mechanism within your Protocol to filter unhealthy notifications from service channels and throttle-limit channels with poor spam health score? Our users also able to control spam-related content?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nHahaha, yeah we understand the problem users face when it comes to unsolicited and spam notifications \ud83d\ude05. We actually thought a ton about it and there are a couple of ways by which we mitigate the issue (everything happens on protocol :)):\\n\\n1. Users have to opt in to receive notifications from the service first before they can start communicating. This ensures that users are always in control, if they unsubscribe, there is no way for a service to add to them.\\n\\n2. To ensure that a service doesn\u2019t turn malicious later on, we attach a Spam Score to them as well which is adjusted by both positive (higher number of subscribers, the passage of time, etc) and negative (unusual number of notifications, a higher number of unsubscribes, etc) actions. This score when it crosses a certain threshold activates the protocol throttle mechanism which is a way to penalize services a bit at first and if they don\u2019t stop then making the throttling go high thereby ensuring that it\u2019s always in the best interest of services to not spam their users.\\n\\nWe are also planning verified badges in the future to ensure that while everyone can create a channel and everyone can opt-in, there is a distinction between spammy channels and verified ones.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nSo, users can control this by subscribing and unsubscribing \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes, the user is in control \ud83d\udcaa\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nDid you already notice spammers on your services? Or they didn\u2019t try?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nLol, they are definitely trying more on staging for now \ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nThey also in beta \ud83d\ude02\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\n\ud83d\ude05\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nThank you! I am sure you won\u2019t give them any chances \ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nReady for the next question?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes, please.\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nQ3 from Telegram user @AmirJosh  \\nDevice token is a unique key for the app-device combination which is issued by the Apple or Google push notification gateways. Can you please explain further what is Device Tokens importance and functions needed to be able to make it compatible or work efficiently with EPNS App?\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nSeems like someone really is into push! The Apple (and google) push notification gateway also works on the concept of a middleware handling all the notifications from every app and ensuring that the user has opted in for it. In apple\u2019s case, it\u2019s called APNs (Apple Push Notification Service) which is why we choose EPNS (Ethereum Push Notification Service).\\n\\nTo answer this in TLDR \u2192 For Receiving Decentralized Notifications: Each platform has its rules in engaging push notifications. The way EPNS works is that it standardizes the communication layer and the payload emitted out (whether encrypted or plain) which is then read by our infrastructure (or other infra) nodes who can then compose the notification payload out and push it out to the app (essentially decentralized to centralized carrier delivery).\\n\\nWhile we are planning for the nodes will be p2p in the future and will allow wss connections, the receiving part for specific apps logic is left onto them. For us or anyone who wants to push them out to iOS or Android (for example our app or other third-party apps who wants in) will need to enter their creds in the node which is not shared and need to have our SDK in their app. The SDK essentially will be responsible for connecting device tokens to wallet addresses and the rest of the thing is already taken care of by our protocol!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nGreat system!\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nWill you use your own token in this system? If so, when and how people can obtain it?\u263a\ufe0f\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nYes, we do have our governance token $PUSH that will enable users to govern the protocol, handle game theory between all our participants, and\u2026 \ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41have reward/pool sharing built into it so every player wins!!\\n\\nWe will also have liquidity/usage mining that will reward participants among several other use cases.\\n\\nThey are incoming and not yet out\u2026 we will have an announcement on it pretty soon \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\ngreat! \ud83d\udc4d we will be waiting for an announcement then \ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\n\ud83e\udd1d\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nCool, stay tuned Satoshiclubbers \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:  \\n**Ready to proceed?\ud83d\ude00\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes, please.\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nThank you for the great answers!\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:  \\n**Q4 from Telegram user @K2ice  \\nIf am right, the current focus of EPNS now is sending notifications directly to user wallets. Are there plans to include Telegram, Twitter, and other platforms in the nearest future?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYou are 100% right! This is where EPNS is really flexible, we are platform agnostic so in the future, we can deliver notifs to telegram, Twitter, or to any other platform as well!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nDo you see user\u2019s demand in this?\ud83d\ude00\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nWe do see some users wanting it, but most want it pseudonym, exactly like their wallet address without any identity connection..like the rest of the Web3 which is why we are first focusing on wallet addresses.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nOh, understand \ud83d\ude02\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nBtw, which notification services do you see as your competitors?\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nWe are the first one to do this so no direct competitors ;). Some indirect ones do it differently in which they monitor a few smart contract and events and ask users to log in to their centralized platforms and create hooks which in essence only adds to the problem as a) they pick and choose smart contracts and b) how can the user be expected of keeping track of all notifs (imagine if every time you installed Telegram, you had to go somewhere, register and add hooks to receive emails), now try it with 50+ services. While these indirect competitors have created awesome tech, we feel that the middleware which we are creating in essence enables this to be done smoother and see them as our future partners \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nYes, you\u2019re right! Better become partners\ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nReady to jump to the next question?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes.\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nQ5 from Telegram user @Antoni_azx  \\nThere\u2019s a medium article called \u201cBuilding the cities of the future with EPNS\u201d, It\u2019s about a fictional city and its citizens that interact with various processes and gives an idea of how EPNS could eventually impact our lives, will this all stay fictional? How are you planning to get these features in real life?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nThanks for going through the post! Hope you loved the vision! Any tech which we use at the moment was fictional at one point in time ;). Jetsons and facetime, anyone?\\n\\nWe imagine facetime to become decentralized, DeFi to have mass adoption, Governance of projects done by several users, gaming characters to be truly unique, your mails, and data staying with you among countless other things.\\n\\nAll of this requires communication and services to come to users when their attention is required. Like how TG is sending us notifications of users joining our channels from your awesome Satoshi Club which is of importance to us :). This experience of Web2.0 is needed to enable adoption for Web3.0.\\n\\nFor example, when you take a loan from a bank before it\u2019s liquidated, you are sent several alerts from your bank. The same or any type of alert is not present in Web3.0 and it creates blockers for innovation that we see to be 10x better than web2 yet still have user engagement and experience issues.\\n\\nAll of this led us to research and create a protocol that is infinitely extensible to not only handle notifs that are text but can also handle any type of payload (which in essence is what APNs do as well). This enables us to send even right now notifs that can carry CTA, Youtube Videos, Encrypted Transactions, or anything else that is imaginable.\\n\\nIn essence, we have already created that standard which is content independent (allowing usage for any service imaginable), storage independent (support IPFS, smart contract, and any other storage standard that comes out), supports encryption (to support chats, video calls, MFA, etc) and delivery independent (platform and in future blockchain agnostic).\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nWhat is your nearest goal now? And which goal is the most important?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nAudit and Mainnet \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nYou are building a very useful service in people\u2019s lives, to be honest\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nOh, I see\ud83d\ude02 do you already started with audit?\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nGolden words \ud83d\udc4f\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\n\ud83d\udc96\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nWe are talking with various firms and trying to see which one works best!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\n\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nNice approach! thank you for answers! ready for the last question from part 1?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nSure!\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:  \\n**Q6 from Telegram user @Indomiekuy  \\nI read your telegram that EPNS already has a partnership with Aave and Matic Network, as I know Matic is a layer2 scaling solution and Aave is Defi protocol focus for deposit and borrowing. What is the result of EPNS with Aave and Matic from work together? Do you have a plan for other partnerships in the future?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\n**Thanks for going through them! Both of them are extremely important to us. Fun fact: When we first started building PoC, Stani was the one who told us we would love to personally use this service and when Stani says that he would want something, you have to go and build it out ;).\\n\\nAAVE is used by us to generate interest and of course, we love them a ton! Matic is our goto solution for L2, both for making sure, notifs are delivered faster, become cheaper for services, and also to scale the solution to match web2 standards!\\n\\nWe are always on the lookout for great partnerships and synergies! Heavy believers of win-win game theory \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nYes, Matic is becoming one of the leaders of l2 solutions!\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes, they\u2019re awesome!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nWill we hear about some new partnerships soon?\ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nMaybe you can give us some hints already? \ud83d\ude04\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nWe are told by our advisors to be \ud83e\udd2b about this! but many more coming soon!\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nGot it \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nOhhhh\ud83d\ude02 those advisors\ud83d\ude02\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nBut I understand.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nWe will wait for news from EPNS!\\n\\n**Part 2 \u2014 live questions from the Telegram community**\\n\\n**_Q1 from Telegram user @Pro Trader_**\\n\\n**Do you have any plans to earn money from ads?**\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nThat\u2019s a really cool use case, and yes we will be exploring the possibilities, and yes we have something in the future pipeline but which would again be user opt-in.\\n\\n**_Q2 from Telegram user @Memo_**\\n\\n**I understand that EPNS is only responsible for sending the notification, no matter what its content is, but is this really not dangerous for you? In case they are inappropriate content, could you not be accused or prosecuted for being an accomplice publishing it?**\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nYes, we thought about this a ton! Innovation often can be misused and in the end, we tried to tackle this by ensuring governance takes care of removing the channel if it used for a nefarious purpose. Also, open to awesome ideas as this is ever-growing and evolving protocol.\\n\\n**_Q3 from Telegram user @Luis_**  \\n\u26d4\ufe0f **Only services can decide what to communicate to their users. Are these services exclusively focused on user preferences, or can any non-wanted service be spammed all the same?**\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nUser preference is a future feature which ensures that user even can conditionalize it from there end. if a service spams after a while then spam throttle index of protocol will ensure that they are penalized by throlling notifications via a quadratic formula.\\n\\n**_Q4 from Telegram user @Jade_**\\n\\n\u2705 **EPNS says that is the missing piece that needs the WEB3, so apart of its desktop version, EPNS can be integrated to wallets like Metamask or Trustwallet?**\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nYes!

Percentage-wise, how high is this interest? Are there other incentive protocols that you will employ to entice more users to use EPNS PUSH notifications?**\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nSince generated interest as well as the stake of channel defines incentives (and opens up possibility of incentivized promotion for them), it becomes tricky to answer it. The user passive income depends on what channels they have subscribed and what those channels have offered. Pro tip: this is a passive income so subscribe to notifications you want which will make the experience of Web3 better :).\\n\\nWe will be having other incentive protocols in the future and there is going to be rewarded for active user participation as well \ud83c\udf89 Stay tuned for a very detailed reward of EPNS guide which will come out very soon!\\n\\n**_Q10 from Telegram user @Roger Grass_**\\n\\n**Can EPNS be in the BSC or Tron network rather than eth where the gas fee is getting higher?**\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nSure! While we have Ethereum in the name, we actually are blockchain agnostic! It\u2019s just that we would want to tackle the problem of DeFi first hence EPNS and why we are on Ethereum first! That, and besides the awesome support we have gotten from the community means that we have to solve this for them first and then get it to others \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n# Part 3 \u2014 Quiz Results\\n\\nAs usual, for the third part, Satoshi Club Team asked the chat 4 questions about the crypto project.
