Now with Push notifications, Safe users can rest easy knowing they are in complete control and up to date on the status of their assets with real-time notifications to keep them informed.\\n\\nSafe is a collective asset management platform that provides a secure way for web3 organizations and users to manage their crypto funds. Unlike traditional wallets, Safe is a multi-signature smart contract wallet that allows users to define a list of owner/signer accounts and a threshold number of signers required to confirm a transaction. This feature makes Safe a popular choice for DAOs and other decentralized organizations that require the management of pooled funds.\\n\\nThe addition of notifications through Push Protocol will enhance the accessibility of transparent infomation tied to the Safe platform. By allowing users to gain real-time insights into the status of their transactions, notifications will enable users to take timely action whenever need be.\\n\\n## Push X Safe: Empowering Secure Asset Management\\n\\nAs a trusted decentralized custody protocol, easier transparent communication is now an additional feature Safe users can benefit from. Enhanced by Push, Safe users can feel confident about always being up to date on the state of their assets and transactions.\\n\\n<blockquote>It is great to see Push protocol integrating with Safe to offer our users another surface to have their pending transaction and signature notifications. We want to make smart account usability be akin to the simplicity of web2 and communication will play a part in that. \u2014 Lukas Schor, Co-founder of Safe</blockquote>\\n\\nBy opting in to Push notifications, Safe users can be notified of any pending signatures or executions of all the safes in a particular wallet address. Push is looking forward to exploring new ways to enhance the Safe UX with notifications and are excited for what\u2019s to come.\\n\\n<blockquote>\u201cWe\u2019re excited to see these pending transaction notifications take effect and similarly excited to explore additional opportunities for using web3 communication to enhance Safe\u2019s UX\u201d \u2014 Harsh Rajat, Push Protocol CEO & Co-founder</blockquote>\\n\\nIt\u2019s Push\u2019s goal that this collaboration with Safe will showcase a way in which web3 organizations and individuals can better monitor their crypto assets.\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to be working alongside the Safe team and paving the way for a safer and more decentralized future.\\n\\n## About Safe\\n\\nSafe (previously Gnosis Safe) is a on-chain asset custody protocol, securing ~$40 Billion in assets today.
