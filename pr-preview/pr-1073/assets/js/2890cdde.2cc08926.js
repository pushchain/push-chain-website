Thus, they are fungible items."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now, consider an art piece by Picasso. Can you replace the original art piece with any other art representing the exact same details and value? Not really.

If you own the NFT pegged to a Picasso, you actually have the proof-of-ownership of the painting that is based on a blockchain.
