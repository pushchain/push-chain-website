Despite the onset of the pandemic, we saw the crypto world booming, as DeFi started to explode and blockchain saw innovation at its height!\\n\\nIt is humbling to rewind over the past year and take a look back at what we have been able to achieve. From ideation to creation, and the alpha launch of EPNS protocol and products on Ropsten\u2026 it has been a awesome year so far, and we look forward to growing into greater heights in the year to come and are ever so grateful for the opportunities given.\\n\\nWe think the biggest credit goes to the love, support and backing of our AWESOME community! Though I also think equal credit belongs to the team ..for the efforts they did to enable coordinated remote work and timings; for adjusting their schedules and their timezones; for achieving a collaborative, conducive and fulfilling team environment, which when put together enabled us to achieve the vision of making EPNS what it is today!\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\\n\\nWelcome to the EPNS 2020 Rewind! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 where we summarize the major highlights of the year and go through loads of awesome nostalgic vibes!\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf1f**Reaching for the Stars \u2014 Our Journey**\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\n2020 marked the birth of EPNS. Since the ideation of EPNS back in January, it took us a couple of months to bring the idea to Ethereum Foundation who guided us to ETHGlobal HackMoney where we hacked and #buidl EPNS protocol and product MVP. With awesome guidance and mentorship from the folks at ETHGlobal team, AAVE, etc. the idea was refined, vetted, and validated thoroughly.\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{borderRadius: \'32px\'}} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwwnlmUpRsk\\" title=\\"Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\n<ImageText>How it started \ud83d\udc96</ImageText>\\n\\nWe didn\u2019t even realized at that point of the massive support which was incoming from the community and our awesome mentors! Shortly after the hackathon, we were shortlisted by IDEO Collab (30 top DeFi projects from 120+) and were mentored during IDEO PVD (Product Validation Day) to synthesize user feedback and validate the idea. \u2b50\ufe0f\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/IDEOVC/status/1273639750918782977&amp;image=\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"637\\" width=\\"680\\" title=\\"\\" class=\\"eo n ff dy bg\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>\\nThis was shortly followed by getting accepted into the first cohort of Gitcoin KERNEL \ud83c\udf31 from which we graduated as top 20 finalists! We \u2764\ufe0f \ud83c\udf31 Forever!\\n\\n![First Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nGitcoin Demo Day!!\\n\\nAlso, around this time, we got awarded grants from Matic and AAVE which motivated and encouraged us to shoot for the stars \ud83c\udf20. Digressing from the journey a bit, we just want to highlight how awesome ecosystems requires superheros \ud83e\uddb8 who support innovation and Open Source Software (#OSS) projects through Grants! We really can\u2019t thank them enough for all the support extended to all the projects because of them!\\n\\nSpeaking about #OSS, how can we forget the awesomeness Gitcoin has created for all of us through their grants round where community love and support is directly transformed into the quadratic funding for anyone\u2019s next super cool idea!\\n\\nThis was also incidentally the next milestone of the journey and we were blown away by the validation and love the community gave us in [Gitcoin Grants (CLR7)](https://gitcoin.co/grants/936/ethereum-push-notification-service-epns) where we were one of the Top 5 projects by the number of contributors (over 250) \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude4f\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nThanks to all the amazing people who donated to our Gitcoin grant and all our well wishers\\n\\nLater, EPNS also got selected for the CoinList Seed Fall 2020 Batch and they still help us to this very day with whatever things we want to learn about, not to mention that some of the investors of our seed round came in because of them selecting us in their prestigious batch \u2764\ufe0f!\\n\\nThrough out the journey, the thing that stuck out to us was how everyone helped us to grow and supported us at every step\u2026 which became our mantra and we would tell everyone who becomes able in the space to do \ud83d\udc47\\n\\n> \u2b50\ufe0f Pay it forward\u2026 \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f!\\n\\nIn the same spirit, we returned back in Gitcoin #GR8 Round, not as grant participant but this time to proudly support the #GR8 Hackathon, we put forward some bounties for the hackathon and happy to share that all of them are coming back to EPNS ecosystem in the form of amazing features developed by awesome developers!\\n\\nApart from all the grants, accelerators, and hackathons, we were also fortunate and grateful for all the peeps that joined our advisory board, they help, guide and steer us in the right direction almost on a daily basis \ud83d\ude80 and we can\u2019t be here without them.\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-3.webp)\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf1f**Our Backbone \u2014 The Tech/Protocol**\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nEPNS aims to significantly improve the Web3 infrastructure by providing a critical yet, a missing piece in Web3 that directly correlates to User Experience \u2014 a decentralized communication middleware for Web3 services to send notifications to users wallets.\\n\\nYear 2020 saw the release of our EPNS Protocol on [Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xb02E99b9634bD21A8e3E36cc7adb673287A8FeaC#writeProxyContract) that paved the way for the first time for decentralzied notifications to operate! This was shortly followed with **_\u201cnotification receiving\u201d_** platforms that enabled users to experience these notification just by signing through their wallet address.\\n\\nThese included alpha versions of the EPNS [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/ethereum-push-service-epns/id1528614910) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.epns.epns) app as well as EPNS [dApp](https://apps.apple.com/app/ethereum-push-service-epns/id1528614910). Of course the vision is to have EPNS protocol integrated across all user wallets for a seamless notification experience.\\n\\nWe also published the EPNS [Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.epns.io/) (and [Litepaper](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/ethereum-push-notification-service-litepaper-e7ca0a662862)) earlier this year.\\n\\nWe also have been building some cool channels that can deliver much needed notifications to the users. So far we have deployed the following channels on our dApp (check them out at [https://app.epns.io)](https://app.epns.io).) with more coming soon! Team favorites channels are ETHGas, ENS Domain Expiry, ETH Tracker and BanklessFR so far!\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-4.gif)\\n\\nOur vision of being a **Web3 Standard for Notification** is tightly coupled with a feature packed roadmap, we are working on it and still have few things to add (colored post-it are different cogs of the ecosystem), having said that, here\u2019s a sneak peek \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-5.webp)\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf1f**Seed Announcement**\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nThe awesome journey and folks enabled us to raise our seed round which got announced during the start of December! We were able to successfully raised $750k at a valuation of $5 million. **$PUSH for the win!\\\\*\\\\* More than the raise! we are humbled and grateful for the support of Web3 Leaders and notable VCs who backed our vision of decentralized notifications and are our long term partners!\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-6.webp)\\n\\nVisit [epns.io](http://epns.io) for all our awesome investors \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf1fWebsite 2.0 \u2014 epns.io\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nWe were thrilled for finally having a website that let\u2019s us put out and explain our vision to the World. We launched it along with our seed announcement and with a heavily biased recommendation we ask everyone to check it out: [Website](https://epns.io/).\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf1f**Conferences, Talks, AMAs\u2026Events Galore!!!**\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nWith most of us living the digital life this year, it also meant that there were no more physical barriers to attend events and host conferences. This year was packed with lots of amazing virtual events and talks that we were thrilled to be a part of.\\n\\nHere is a quick round-up of some of the many events we had been a part of in 2020.\\n\\n## **Ask Me Anything:**\\n\\n- EPNS AMA with Matic\\n- EPNS AMA with Bundle Africa\\n- EPNS AMA with AMA Lovers Club\\n\\n## **Conferences and Workshops:**\\n\\n- 2.5 Talk Show at ETHBerlin\\n- ETHCon Korea\\n- Gitcoin: Welcome to Web3\\n- EDCON 2020\\n- BlockHash LIVE 2020\\n- Chainlink Hackathon Workshop\\n- Gitcoin Grants #GR8 Hackathon Workshop\\n- Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) Asia Pacific 2020\\n- ETHIndia Mentorship session\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-7.webp)\\n\\nAnd so many more!! We are very grateful to all the organizers and sponsors for giving us the opportunity\\n\\nThere is nothing better than speaking to the community and educating everyone about the possibilities of DeFi, Game Theory, and Decentralized Notifications and then answering their questions and queries. We loved every second of talking to you all, and we hope to speak with the community at large more in the year to come.\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf1f**EPNS Featured!**\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nEPNS was proud to be featured in a number of articles, newsletters, and other publications. Some notable ones include **Ethereum Foundation Official Blog**, **TheBlock**, **EtherWorld**, **TheDailyGewi** & **EthHub** by **Anthony Sassano**, **Alex Saunders** of **Nugget\u2019s News**, **DeFiDad**, **CoinTelegraph**, **DeFiTimes**, **YourStory**, **MojKripto**, **Product Hunt Launch** \ud83d\ude80, **Dapp.com** and many many more \ud83d\ude03!\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf1f**Our Heart Beat \u2014 The Community**\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nEPNS would have never reached where it is without the awesome Web3 community backing us.
