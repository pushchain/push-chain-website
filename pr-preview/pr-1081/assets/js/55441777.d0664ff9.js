No matter what you plan on building, we have both a web3-native communication tool and bounty waiting for you.\\n\\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of all the prizes:\\n\\n### 1. \ud83c\udfc6 Namaste Push Protocol \u2e3a $2,000\\n\\n<b>Number of winners: 1</b>\\n\\nBefore it was GM GM, this week it\u2019s \\"Namaste!\\"\\n\\nThis bounty celebrates the best use of Push Protocol in social-based DApps. From leveraging Push Notifications for vital alerts to exploring Notification settings for customization, and integrating chat functionality with the power of conditional gating \u2013 this is your chance to make a meaningful impact by merging social initiatives with technology.\\n\\nHere are a few ideas for inspiration:\\n\\n- <b>SocialImpactHub</b>: A DApp dedicated to social activists, where users can receive notifications about upcoming rallies or events. Consider using conditional gating to enable activists with specific badges or tokens to access private planning rooms.\\n- <b>EcoAlert</b>: An environmental initiative platform where users can chat about sustainable practices and get notified about eco-friendly events or sudden environmental crises.\\n- <b>CommunityCare</b>: A local community dApp where neighbors can communicate in real time, set up events, and receive notifications about local emergencies or activities. With conditional gating, special groups could be set up for neighborhood committees or watch groups.\\n- <b>PushForChange</b>: A fundraising platform that sends out notifications about new charitable campaigns. Users can chat with charity organizers and use conditional gating to access exclusive fundraising events based on their donation history.\\n\\nThe \\"Namaste Push Protocol\\" Prize is all about acknowledging the innovative spirit of developers who want to make a meaningful impact in the world using Push Protocol.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49Our all-in-one\u2728 [Hacker Building Guide for Push Protocol](https://comms.push.org/docs/hackers/) \u2728\\n\\n### 2. \ud83c\udfc6 Creativity Prize \u2e3a $2,500\\n\\n<b>Number of winners: 1</b>\\n\\nUnleash your innovation!
