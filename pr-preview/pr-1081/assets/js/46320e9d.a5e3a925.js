Continue reading to learn how.\\n\\nBefore this proposal, the official PIP\u2019s approval process was a 3-step process as follows:\\n\\n<b>Proposal Phase</b> \u2014 Here, the draft proposal is posted at https://gov.epns.io/. At this stage, the proposal must receive at least 5 likes and be on the forum for at least 5 days.\\n\\n<b>Discussion Phase</b> \u2014 The PIP number is assigned at this stage, and more community discussion is encouraged. The PIP must receive at least 10 likes and 3 comments and be in this category for at least 5 days.\\n\\n<b>Voting Phase</b> \u2014 The proposal is voted on and passed or rejected. In this final stage, the PIP will be up for voting for 7 days.\\n\\nA PIP takes at least 17 days to pass through this method. And while effective, it might not be efficient enough in some cases where a proposal might receive immediate positive traction from the community.\\n\\nNow that <b>PIP-08 </b>is approved, the process can be significantly expedited once a proposal meets certain criteria, reducing its time for the approval to 5 days.\\n\\n## Here is how a PIP gets passed at full tilt via fast-tracking:\\n\\nStep 1: Post the draft proposal in the Governance Proposals section of the forum.\\n\\nStep 2: The proposal must receive a minimum of 7 likes and 5 comments in favor <b>in the first 48hrs of being added to the forum</b>.\\n\\nStep 3: The proposal will be assigned a PIP number in the discussion forum and be promoted to Snapshot, skipping the discussion phase.\\n\\nStep 4: Promote to Snapshot with immediate vote open for 3 days.\\n\\n### Important considerations to fast-track your proposals\\n\\n1. Fast-track requires a quorum (i.e., 1% of total votes ~ 153k PUSH as of August 17, 2022 )\\n2. Proposals that don\u2019t meet the criteria on any steps will continue the standard flow.\\n3. For the comments on the proposal to be considered, they must be made by users with at least a <b>Basic</b> trust level (Level 1). The questions asked by users with<b> Member</b> trust level (Level 2) and above must be answered to continue with the Fast-track process. More information on trust levels can be found [here](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/)."}}')}}]);
