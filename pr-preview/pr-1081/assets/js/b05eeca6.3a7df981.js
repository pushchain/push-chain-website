Another month has passed in the blink of an eye proving that fun never ends in the crypto-lands.\\n\\nMarch was focused on our efforts around preparing for our Token Generation Event (TGE), let\u2019s look at what\u2019s been keeping us busy.\\n\\n# Preparing for the big $PUSH\\n\\nIt took a lot on everyone\u2019s part, and we did this as a team!\\n\\nPreparing for the launch of $PUSH required orchestrating several moving pieces and making sure solid non-stop progress was being made in the correct order. These are some of the key high-level tasks involved in this process:\\n\\n- Development of TGE related Smart contracts (**$PUSH** token, Staking, and Time Vesting smart contracts) and their corresponding internal auditing followed by a formal audit by the ChainSafe team ([See the official Audit results here](https://twitter.com/ChainSafeth/status/1379879154124943361)).\\n- Design of incentive mechanisms for participants of the protocol.\\n- Following all steps to ensure a successful IDO (Initial Dex Offering) launch on April 13th, 2021.\\n- Coordinating strategic collaborations with key players in the blockchain space to help us further refine EPNS. Announced pilot programs with \ud83e\udd84 [Uniswap](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1377305643384664065?s=20), [SuperFluid](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1374677663915200520?s=20) and [Gnosis](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1371816495563501577?s=20).\\n\\n# EPNS 2021 Roadmap\\n\\nThis past month culminated a process of learning and discovery that allowed us to understand more precisely what the Ethereum ecosystem needs, and how can we best provide the right infrastructure to help.\\n\\nWe will soon be releasing our **Official Roadmap** together with a complementary blog post sharing more information about what we have accomplished and what\u2019s going to be our focus for the rest of the year.\\n\\n![First Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n# Development\\n\\nWhile most of our development efforts in March 21021 were around TGE, we are also getting everything ready to welcome the development community to start implementing the EPNS protocol. These are some of the key development items accomplished through March 2021:\\n\\n- Development of smart contracts, granular testing scripts, and deployment scripts for all the TGE related smart contracts.\\n- Internal auditing of all smart contracts.\\n- Fixes and optimizations performed after feedback from the auditing firm.\\n- Front-ends for token vesting, claiming NFTs, staking and liquidity mining.\\n- Integration Guides including complex scenarios covering the different types of integrations. These will soon be approved for release.\\n- Started working on various Pilot Program EPNS implementations with our strategic partners.\\n- Implemented ENS/Crypto domain support.\\n\\n# Community Updates\\n\\nOur highlights for March 2021:\\n\\n- **Conferences**: Harsh Rajat spoke at [#Unblock2021](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1367397526156967937?s=20), India\u2019s biggest blockchain-based virtual summit, about\ufe0f the EPNS journey! \u2014 Our very own Richa Joshi spoke at [KBA Blockchain Bootcamp on Women\u2019s Day](https://twitter.com/kbaiiitmk/status/1375315945820852229?s=20) \u2014 Harsh Rajat spoke at Streamr Data Challenge panel discussion on \u2018[Building the Internet of Ethereum](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1369993408220078087?s=20)\u2019 and [DeFiicon](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1367043415234342913?s=20).\\n- **Featured**: Honored to be featured by Hackernoon \u2018[Push Notifications Will Pull Blockchain Out of the Stone Age of Communication](https://hackernoon.com/push-notifications-will-pull-blockchain-out-of-the-stone-age-of-communication-unhashed-1-ql1f33d6)\u2019\\n- **Blog posts**: March 2021 we talked about [$PUSH Token Economics](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-token-economics-d7f566c29b1a), and also made the [Formal Announcement of EPNS $PUSH Token Generation Event](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/announcing-the-epns-push-token-generation-event-4d1699e716f5).
