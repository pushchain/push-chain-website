It marks the pinnacle of an effort that started a little more than a year ago, and it also marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey towards bringing Web3 notifications to the Ethereum ecosystem.\\n\\nLet‚Äôs take a look at all things that took place over this month!\\n\\n## Milestone: Token Generation Event üëè\\n\\nA gigantic part of this milestone is thanks to the support and feedback from our beloved community, and our awesome investors and advisors.\\n\\nPutting together so many initiatives to guarantee an awesome launch was not an easy task. And while many of these strategies were moving pieces that we started working on since last month‚Ä¶ this month it was time to assemble!\\n\\nStep one during the Token Genesis compromised a meticulous development, testing, and [auditing](https://epns.io/EPNS-release-Audit.pdf) of our token, time lock, vesting, and staking smart contracts. Followed shortly by:\\n\\n## EPNS $PUSH listing & Rewards Program\\n\\n![First Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nOur listings phase started with our IDO on Polkastarter and caught a massive attention and participation from the community. Later on the same day we were rolling with our listing in Uniswap and our ETH-PUSH pool up & running. And just a couple of days after, our listing in **WazirX** (India‚Äôs largest exchange).\\n\\nAll this setting the stage for the successful launch of the [**EPNS Rewards Program**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-liquidity-rewards-program-d16ff2c0fef4), offering a total of 5,510,000 $PUSH to be distributed along the program and ending on 15th March 2023.\\n\\nThe [incentives website](http://incentives.epns.io/) launched with two pools: The PUSH Staking Pool, and the Uniswap LP Pool; allowing users to participate in yield farming and liquidity mining opportunities, and to enjoy awesome APYs ‚Äî especially for early participants!.\\n\\n## Gratitude Drop & ROCKSTARS of EPNS\\n\\n![Second Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-2.gif)\\n\\nTo thank the community and early advisors & supporters for being with us in every step of this journey, we decided to show a token of our appreciation to all those who donated to us on Gitcoin Rounds 6 and 7, and also to all early protocol users (snapshot as of 20th March, 2021).\\n\\nBut it doesn‚Äôt end there! With our [ROCKSTARS of EPNS](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf) NFT collection, we also want to express our gratitude to our early backers that have helped us get where we are, and offer the opportunity for community members to collaborate in different ways to own one piece of this prestigious collection.\\n\\n# The EPNS 2021 Roadmap üåç\\n\\n![Third Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-3.webp)\\n\\nWe just released to the public our [Roadmap for 2021](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12).
