This allows for the flexible and streamlined transfer of the notificationâ€™s data from a decentralized storage environment. Further, the information is transmitted and recorded on-chain, following due validation. Leveraging EPNS Infra, decentralized protocols can also send notifications to centralized environments. To send notifications, Channels have to bear a fee, payable in ETH or DAI. Apart from directly sending notifications to Subscribers, Channels can also delegate declared wallet addresses to transmit notifications on their behalf.
