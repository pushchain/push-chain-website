Push is a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain that allows developers to create universal apps and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s, and L3s enabling transactions from any chain - any app and any user.\\n\\n**Push Chain\'s Superpowers Include:**\\n\\n- Consumer tx (unordered) and Traditional tx (ordered)\\n\\n- Any Chain Tx (Solana, Eth, EVM, or non-EVM)\\n\\n- Sub-second finality\\\\*\\\\*  \\n\\n- True Scale and Universal Smart Contracts\\n\\n- Wallet and Fee Abstraction\\n\\n[Explore more about Push Chain here](https://push.org)\\n\\n## 👥 What does this mean for Gaia and Push Chain Users?\\n\\n**Interact with Universally operable AI Agents**\\n\\nWith Push’s Universal capabilities - users operating AI agents built on Gaia can conveniently perform autonomous tasks across any chain!\\n\\n## 👷‍♂️ What does this mean for Builders?\\n\\n**Develop Universally Operable AI Agents**\\n\\nWith Gaia and Push, Builders can create borderless ai agents - that can perform financial, mixed financial and consumer read/write operations across any chain in an autonomous manner.\\n\\n**Build Agents with Universal Identities**\\n\\nLeveraging PushID ( A unified user identity by Push Chain that spans across every user wallet, both EVM and non-EVM). Instances of Gaia agents can carry a unified identity that aggregates their activity across all chains - simplifying agent tracking, history collection and analysis.\\n\\n## 🔓Usecase unlock\\n\\n**Cross Chain AI agents with autonomous intelligence**\\n\\nHaving the ability to execute actions between any chains, irrespective of their virtual machine design, with the power of Push Chain’s Universal Smart Contracts and Shared State ledger.\\n\\n**Unified Data Layers for AI Agents**\\n\\nData Layers like [Oxscope](https://www.0xscope.com/) can utilize Push Chain’s shared state settlement layer to read transactions across chains in a unified manner.\\n\\n**Chain Agnostic Autonomous Actions**\\n\\nAutonomous agents like [Eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) can extend its support for Push Chain, opening opportunities for chain-abstracted interoperable communications and actions.\\n\\nExample: rebalance a user\'s DeFi positions on Ethereum, list NFTs on Polygon, and communicate status updates to the user via a messaging app on another chain, all through one unified settlement layer\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n1. Follow [@PushChain on X](https://x.com/PushChain) to get the latest updates about Push Chain\\n2. Want to build on Push Chain? Explore the docs and example snippets here → [Push Chain Docs](https://push.org/docs/chain/)\\n3. Visit the [Push Chain Website](https://push.org/chain?utm_source=pushblog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pcgov) to find a one-pager explanation of the vision.\\n4. Check out the [Push Chain Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.push.org/?utm_source=pushblog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pcgov) for a detailed overview of the vision and the underlying technicalities.\\n5. [Push Chain Devnet](https://scan.push.org/?utm_source=pushblog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pcgov) is running live on Proof-of-Stake network validators, storage and archival nodes. The network already supports consumer transactions as well.\\n6. [Push Chain Simulate Tx](https://simulate.push.org/?utm_source=pushblog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pcgov) already provides a way for everyone to send tx from any chain using wallet abstraction."}}');
