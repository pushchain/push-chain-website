So weâ€™ll just spend one sentence saying THANK YOU to the EPNS community for all your support over the last two years. ðŸ’– Ok, letâ€™s dive in:\\n\\n**EPNS is Live: What This Means & How to Start**\\n\\nEPNS can now be accessed through [app.epns.io](http://app.epns.io) on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol can be used by two broad audiences: **channels** and **subscribers.**\\n\\n**Channels** are dapps, users, and businesses that want to send notifications to others. These notifications can be sent manually, or they can be built to respond automatically to on-chain or off-chain information. For example, a media company can push out alerts for breaking news when a story is released. Or, a DeFi project can allow users to automatically receive notifications when their loans are closing in on liquidation.\\n\\n_How to get started as a channel?_ Head to [app.epns.io](http://app.epns.io) and â€˜Create Your Channelâ€™. Follow the guided steps to set up your channel, create notifications, and publish your channel to mainnet. Then, watch the subscribers roll in. If you need support, head to [How to EPNS](https://www.notion.so/epns/How-to-EPNS-853afe64839b4cdd8c63209342a783d0) for more information.\\n\\n**Subscribers** are those who wish to receive notifications from others. Subscribers can browse the live channels on EPNS through the app, and opt-in to receive notifications from any of them. Notifications are then delivered to the subscriberâ€™s â€˜inboxâ€™. Channels are live now on the EPNS app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/ethereum-push-service-epns/id1528614910)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.epns.epns)), with more channels to be launched in the days and weeks to come.\\n\\n_How to get started as a subscriber?_ Head to [app.epns.io](http://app.epns.io) and click on â€˜Channelsâ€™. You can browse the list of all published channels, each with a description of which notification(s) youâ€™ll receive if you subscribe. You may opt-in to receive notifications from any of them, and opt-out at any time.\\n\\n\\\\*_Note: the EPNS protocol has been under development for 1+ year, and completed a_ [_ChainSafe audit_](https://epns.io/EPNS-Protocol-Audit2021.pdf) _in October 2021. However, the mainnet is still a new product milestone. Always DYOR, and anticipate bugs and UI improvements. Learn how to report any bugs in our_ [_Discord_](https://discord.gg/YVPB99F9W5)_._\\n\\n**Whatâ€™s Next for EPNS**\\n\\nMainnet launch is just the beginning for EPNS. Stay tuned for more channel releases in the days and weeks to come â€” and ask your favorite dapps to create channels of their own! Weâ€™ll post more information about the post-mainnet roadmap for EPNS soon, but expect incentives, governance, multi-chain support, and more!\\n\\nFollow us to stay up to date: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/YVPB99F9W5), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject)."}}');
