Keep reading!\\n\\n## Hi Michael, what\u2019s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\\n\\n<b>Michael:</b> My blockchain journey started a few years ago. Coming from computer science and game design backgrounds as well as creating various content as a hobby, I saw the tremendous potential Web3 can bring to each of these directions. Kernel from Gitcoin has been my gateway into the decentralized world and taught me a lot about the values of the new web, most importantly about the sense of community and the power of decentralization on an ethical level. I believe whoever wants to start building in Web3 should stop asking what Web3 could do for them and instead ask what they could do for Web3.<br/><br/>\\n\\n<blockquote>Gaming was always my passion, and I\u2019ve seen it as one of the biggest use cases for blockchain and especially NFT technologies. And here we are, building a pixel art MMO we call Tollan Worlds.</blockquote>\\n\\n## Tell us about Tollan Worlds \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem does Tollan Words solve?\\n\\n<b>Michael:</b> Tollan Worlds is an online role-playing game where you play as an escapee from an authoritarian city with an imperial mentality called <i>The Mainland</i>. Finding your way through endless Darklands and finally stumbling upon a hidden developing society in the middle of nowhere. That\u2019s where your journey finally begins.\\n\\nPlayers will shape their own path through the main story as well as go to dungeons with their friends and join forces with many other players for massive boss fights. They can explore the vast world where each new place brings new creatures, stories, and unforgettable experiences while being determined to the main objective of defending their new home from the ubiquitous forces of The Mainland.\\n\\nOur main goal is not only to create great gameplay with a deep story but also to create a fair and transparent monetization model while also putting players in charge of their game world, and blockchain allows us to achieve that.\\n\\nTollan Worlds \u201csolves the problem\u201d of both traditional and blockchain gaming worlds. Transparent monetization allows us to be closer to our player base and develop trust and long-term retention of our community. Focusing on the gameplay and story, and escaping Ponzi play2earn schemes allows us to create a game that doesn\u2019t depend on market conditions and where money does not interfere with the core gameplay.\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\" }} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MOJ4hSdbiD0\\" title=\\"Tollan Worlds: The First Adventure Teaser\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\n## How do people play Tollan Worlds?\\n\\n<b>Michael:</b> Our pre-alpha is currently live for a limited amount of users, with only 6,000 spots available.
