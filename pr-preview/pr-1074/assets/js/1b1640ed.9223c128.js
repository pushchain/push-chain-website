As such, users of Commonwealth are poised to receive decentralized push notifications pertaining to the governance process. These notifications increase user participation and keep users updated about every step in the governance lifecycle.\\n\\n## Commonwealth: On-chain Governance Simplified\\n\\nCommonwealth is all-in-one governance and community management protocol. On this platform, anyone can create a community, link their governance contracts, and manage their communities with ease. The core functionalities of Discourse, Snapshot, on-chain voting, synchronous chat tools, and network analytics are all available on one platform for users\\n\\nWhether it is community discussions, treasury management, crowdfunding, or decentralized governance, crypto projects can rely on one go-to platform, making the process easy and accessible.\\n\\nAs such, the platform can benefit from a communication medium that keeps users updated about all the steps in the governance and discussion processes, encouraging user participation. This is where EPNS plays a key role.\\n\\n## What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our collaboration with Commonwealth, we envision the creation of a decentralized communication channel that allows the platform to interact directly with its users. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform and users of Commonwealth can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications at every step of the governance process like whenever\\n\\n- New proposals are up for voting\\n- The voting process is about to end\\n- The results of the voting are declared\\n\\nThis allows users to grab the governance opportunities on Commonwealth at the right time. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a dapp, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\\n\\nWe\u2019re pleased to collaborate with Commonwealth on their journey towards bringing communities together for on-chain events and hope to continue the alliance into the future.\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n### About Commonwealth\\n\\nCommonwealth is a governance and community management protocol. The protocol enables users to claim and govern their communities. Anyone can create a community, link their governance methodology, and discuss the future of their specific community.\\n\\nStay in touch!
