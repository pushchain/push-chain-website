During the 30 day virtual hackathon, we will try to build, design, and deliver a working EPNS app. We plan to push out regular development updates, milestones, and challenges along this journey. The idea is to learn and share the learnings with the community.\\n\\nAt the onset of the project, we are currently working on the architecture and tech specs that we will share in the upcoming posts.\\n\\n#### Meet the Team\\n\\nWe are a mixed bag of techno-functional guys & gals hacking for the first time.\\n![Harsh Rajath Founder Image](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n[Harsh Rajat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshrajat/?originalSubdomain=in): Solidity dev and lover of all things tech. <br />\\nHarsh enjoys playing ps4 doom eternal and classic Whiskey sour!\\n\\n![Richa Joshi Cofounder Image](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n[Richa Joshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richa-joshi-90b04126/): PM, Blockchain researcher <br />\\nRicha is an ardent coffee lover and yoga enthusiast."}}')}}]);
