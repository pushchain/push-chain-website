As such, users of ShapeShift are poised to receive decentralized push notifications pertaining to the governance process. These notifications are designed to increase user participation and keep them updated about every step in the governance procedure.\\n\\n# ShapeShift: The Community-Owned Crypto Exchange\\n\\nAt its core, ShapeShift is a cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to buy, sell, trade, invest, and track digital assets. What distinguishes the platform from the rest is the fact that it is non-custodial, community-owned, and multichain operational. This means that users of the platform enjoy all the conveniences of a centralized crypto exchange while still being able to maintain full privacy and control of their crypto assets at all times. Moreover, there are no KYC or ID proof requirements to trade on the platform, and ShapeShift is the first to offer zero-commission trading to users.\\n\\nAs of this writing, ShapeShift has a lifetime trading volume of $6 billion with over 150,000 monthly active users. And users can benefit by choosing to participate in the platform governance on ShapeShift DAO. However, for the smooth running of the governance process, there is a need for a communication medium that keeps users informed of actionable steps to encourage participation. This is where EPNS plays a key role.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our partnership with ShapeShift, we envision the creation of a decentralized communication channel that allows the platform to directly interact with its users. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform, and users of ShapeShift can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications whenever:\\n\\n- New proposals are created for voting and the voting process begins\\n- The voting process is about to end ( sent 24 hours before)\\n- The results of the voting are declared\\n\\nThis allows users to grab the governance opportunities on ShapeShift at the right time and help steer the direction of its growth. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\\n\\nWe\u2019re pleased to partner with ShapeShift on their journey towards making digital assets highly accessible and hope to continue the alliance into the future.\\n\\n# **About ShapeShift**\\n\\nSince 2014, ShapeShift has been pioneering self-custody for digital asset trading. Today\u2019s ShapeShift DAO is an engaged community of builders working to advance the state of crypto trading, investing and access to open, decentralized financial systems. Our web and mobile platforms empower users to safely buy, hold, trade, invest and interact with digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cosmos.\\n\\nStay in touch!
