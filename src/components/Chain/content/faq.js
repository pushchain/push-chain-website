          Push Chain is a shared-state Layer 1 blockchain built to eliminate fragmentation across all chains.

          By enabling **seamless transactions from any chain** (Ethereum, Solana, EVM or non-EVM), it lets any user interact with web3 apps without juggling multiple wallets, tokens or gas mechanics.

          In short, Push Chain unites L1s ü§ù L2s ü§ù L3s under one cohesive layer.

          ![How Universal Apps Work](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/faq/universalapps.webp)

          Push Chain takes a unique approach to solving the problem of fragmentation across all chains. Instead of creating interop protocol which comes with complexities for both users and developers, it takes a novel approach by building a true universal blockchain that can be natively used by any user from any chain.

          To achieve this, Push Chain leverages several **precompiles** which are custom modules created to:

          1. **Recognize** users of other chains - Universal address standard that extends the address of a user to be blockchain agnostic (based on [CAIP-10 standards](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md)).

          2. **Map** users to Push Chain - This is done by deploying a smart account called UEA (Universal Executor Account) for each user of a different chain. This module is used to deploy a smart account that then uses other precompiles to process the transactions.
          
          3. **Execute** universal transactions - This is done by using USV (Universal Signature Verification) and UTXV (Universal Transaction Verifier) precompiles to verify and execute signatures and transactions from other chains.

          4. **Abstract** away the complexities of the chain they are on - This is done by having universal gateway contracts on each chain that locks gas funds in native token of the chain (or any other compliant token) and then uses the UTXV precompiles to attribute the gas to UEA (Executor Account) and USV to execute the transaction.
          
          This is an **extremely powerful approach** that allows users to interact with any app on Push Chain without worrying about the chain they are on or what wallet they are using as everything is abstracted away, for both the users and the developers.

          Push Chain addresses specific gaps in the existing blockchains, such as interoperability, state access across chains, programmable solvers and wallet abstraction resulting in a **full stack interop**. While existing blockchains are robust, they operate in their own eco-system and an aggregator to unite these chains are needed.

          Push Chain‚Äôs focus is on being a **shared state chain** for universal (interoperable) applications acting as a unifying layer where all chains can come together and use PC as universal hub or do settlement between them.

          It offers a new paradigm of web3 that works from **Any Chain.** For **Any Wallet / User.** And is suitable for **Any App.**

          ![Push Chain Architecture](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/faq/pcoverview.webp)

          Push Chain is a Proof-of-Stake Layer 1 designed to eliminate fragmentation across every blockchain. Under the hood, it combines several key innovations:

          - **True Universal Chain**  
            Natively supports all chains and enables users to interact with the same app. No centralized relayers, bridges, or other hacks needed.

          - **Universal Fee & Wallet Abstraction**  
            Allows users to interact with the app from any chain without worrying about gas or wallet mechanics.

          - **Single transaction for any chain**  
            Users only ever sign a single transaction, no matter from what chain they are interacting from.

          - **Universal Smart Contracts**  
            100% EVM compatible smart contracts that can be deployed with **zero on-chain code changes**. Once deployed, they become instantly compatible with users of all chains.

          - **Universal EVM**  
            Push Chain is smart enough to natively recognize users of other chains and correctly attributes and maps the transactions to them.

          - **Shared State and Programmable Solvers**  
            (Roadmap) Enables smart contracts of Push Chain to read and write state to any other chain. 

          Together, these features let you build **universal web3 apps**. Instead of ‚ÄúUniswap on Ethereum‚Äù or ‚ÄúUniswap on Polygon,‚Äù a user simply becomes **user of Uniswap**‚Äîperiod.

            Unites EVM & non-EVM chains under one shared-state L1, so users never need to hop networks or wallets.

          - **Interoperability**  
            Native support for transactions from any blockchain and on-chain shared state.

          - **Finality**  
            Instant, irreversible native finality in ~1‚Äì2 seconds‚Äîno more waiting or reorgs.

          - **Onboarding & UX**  
            Social/email login, gas-in-any-token & any-wallet support for zero-friction access across chains.

          - **Universal Apps**

            One swap UI for every liquidity pool‚Äîabstracted routing across all chains with the speed and UX of a CEX.

          - **Universal DeFi**  
            A global bank in your browser: lending, borrowing, yield aggregators that span ecosystems without manual bridging.

          - **Universal AI Agents**  
            Autonomous agents that pay and get paid in any token on any chain‚Äîperfect for subscription services, data bots, and more.

          - **Universal DAOs**  
            Cross-chain governance where token holders vote and enact proposals irrespective of their origin chain.

          - **Universal Gaming**  
            Multiplayer tournaments and in-game economies that unite players and assets from Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and beyond.

          - **Universal Marketplace**  
            Buy, sell, and trade NFTs and tokens from every chain in one consolidated marketplace.

          - **Universal Name Service**  
            Human-readable names that resolve to wallets across multiple blockchains.

        {
          type: 'text',
          value: `### Why does Push Chain need to be an L1 instead of an L2 chain?

          Push Chain is built to serve as a **shared settlement layer** and **universal execution layer** for all other blockchains‚Äîroles that only a standalone L1 can fulfill:

          - **Native Cross-Chain Settlement**  
            As an L1, Push Chain can directly finalize transactions from any chain without relying on a separate security or fraud-proof model.

          - **Universal Execution & State Access**  
            Running its own consensus and state machine lets Push Chain interpret and execute transactions from Ethereum, Solana, and beyond‚Äîsomething an L2 (tied to a single base layer) cannot do natively.

          - **No L2 Constraints or Delays**  
            L2s inherit the latency, finality rules, and gas model of their host chain (plus bridging overhead). Push Chain avoids those bottlenecks by offering instant finality and fee abstraction on its own.

          - **True Shared State**  
            To read & write the state of multiple chains within smart contracts, you need direct, protocol-level access‚Äîonly available at the L1 layer.

          In short, only a purpose-built L1 can unify every chain under one cohesive execution and settlement layer without introducing extra complexity or trust assumptions.

          - **EVM Compatibility**  
            Drop in your Solidity contracts and they run unchanged, leveraging Push Chain‚Äôs EVM runtime.

          - **Non-EVM Support**  
            Native precompiles (USV/UTXV) and the universal address standard let Push Chain validate and execute transactions from Solana, Bitcoin, Cosmos SDK chains, and more.

          In practice, users and apps from any chain can interact with Push Chain apps seamlessly ‚Äî no matter the underlying VM.

          Push Chain fills critical gaps that today‚Äôs blockchains, despite being robust, don‚Äôt address:

          - **Interoperability**  
            Existing networks operate in silos, making cross-chain data and asset transfers cumbersome.

          - **Zero-Friction UX**  
            Forget switching wallets or buying chain-specific gas. Social/email login + pay-with-any-token means users jump straight into apps without any onboarding hurdles.

          - **Shared App Experience**  
            With every user on the same Push Chain, your app feels like one cohesive product, not a patchwork of ‚ÄúUniswap on X‚Äù or ‚ÄúUniswap on Y‚Äù.

          - **Universal Execution Layer**  
            No single chain today can natively run transactions and smart contracts that support users from any chain.

          Push Chain is designed as a **shared-state L1 for universal applications**, unifying state and execution across EVM and non-EVM ecosystems. **The result?** Seamless cross-chain interactions and truly universal apps that any user on any chain can access without friction.

          ![Push Chain Universal App](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/faq/pcuniversalapp.webp)

          A traditional blockchain only knows its own ledger and wallet standard. Push Chain extends that model in four key ways:

          1. **Universal Wallet Compatibility**  
            \t- Supports chain agnostic addresses from any chain (Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, Cosmos SDK, etc.)  
            \t- Signatures from any chain are verified via USV/UTXV precompiles, so users never switch wallets.

          2. **Universal Smart Contracts**  
            \t- EVM contracts deploy unchanged but can natively verify and execute cross-chain transactions.  
            \t- Push Chain‚Äôs runtime handles signature mapping and payload parsing for every supported network.

          3. **On-Chain Shared State**  
            \t- Validators commit Merkle proofs of external chain state (via MPT roots) each block.  
            \t- Relayers fetch and submit leaf proofs on demand, so contracts can read any chain‚Äôs data in real time.

          4. **Programmable Solvers**  
            \t- A solver network executes atomic cross-chain workflows (e.g., swap on Chain A, mint on Chain B) under a single transaction.  
            \t- Developers write simple solver scripts; the network handles routing and execution.

          Together, these features turn Push Chain into a **shared-state L1** that enables universal apps to be native to all chains. A world where any user of any chain is able to access and interact with any app on any other chain.

          A **true universal chain** is a blockchain that treats every other network as first class citizens‚Äîno bridges, no centralized relayers, and no compatibility hacks. It delivers:

          1. **Native Multichain Identity**  
            Wallets from Ethereum, Solana, any EVM or non-EVM chains all sign, verify and execute natively on Push Chain. So users never switch accounts or are troubled by the complexities of multiple wallets.

          2. **Unified Settlement**  
            Transactions from any network finalize on Push Chain, giving everyone a single source of truth and enabling the same app to be accessible by users of all chains.

          3. **Single Transaction and Universal Fee Abstraction**  
            Users sign just one transaction, regardless of their source chain and pay gas in any token. No more maintaining or swapping countless tokens to use an app.

          4. **Deploy Once, Use Everywhere**  
            Developers write and deploy smart contracts once (EVM or otherwise) with **zero** extra code ‚Äî one deployment covers all chains.

          Push Chain is the first to bake these features directly into its consensus and runtime, truly eliminating fragmentation ‚Äî no workarounds, no extra layers, just one universal chain for everyone.

The network achieved sub-second finality and has the ability to handle up to [20k transactions per minute](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-chain/blob/main/docs/testnet-performance.md).

          value: `### Are there any risks of centralization with Push Chain?

          **No.** Push Chain‚Äôs architecture emphasizes decentralization.

          Push Chain is fully decentralized and is designed to be robust and resilient. Anyone can run a node and participate in the network and is incentivized or penalized through PoS. To Summarize:

          - Validators and other actors operate independently and are incentivized through PoS.
          - Governance mechanisms ensure community involvement.
          - Every ecosystem party is included in governance to some extent.

          To learn more about how to run a node, see our [Knowledge Base](/knowledge/) or check out our [Validator Node Repo](https://github.com/pushchain/push-chain-node).
