          Push Chain is the first **true universal L1**, purpose built to enable apps to seamlessly be interactable by users of any chain.
          
          Write your smart contract once, deploy it on Push Chain, and instantly reach users on Ethereum, Solana, and all other supported chains without changing on-chain code.`,

          value: `## What is Push Chain?

    Push Chain is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) L1 blockchain that is designed to eliminate fragmentation across all chains.<p />

    It is a **shared state L1** blockchain for **Universal (Interoperable) Apps** across chains. Push Chain enables transactions from any chain (Eth, Solana, EVM, or non-EVM), enabling apps from any chain to be accessed by the users of any chain (**polymarket** from any chain, **pump.fun** from any chain, etc).`,
        },

          value: `## Innovations of Push Chain

    Push Chain introduces several groundbreaking innovations such as:<p />

    **Universal Fee Abstraction** - Allows users to interact natively while being on the chain of their choice and using any tokens they want.<p />

    **Wallet Abstraction** - Support MetaMask, Phantom, and other wallets as well as social or email login through one unified provider. Users never need to create a new wallet to access any apps.<p />

    **Single transaction, no matter the chain** - users can interact with any app on Push Chain with a single transaction. No matter how they choose to interact with the app, they will only ever need to sign a single transaction.<p />

    **Universal Smart Contracts** - Smart contracts are universal and will work instantly without any on-chain code changes or extra steps.<p />

    **Shared State** - enabling developers to read the state of any wallet or smart contract of any other blockchain via smart contract on Push Chain.<p />

    **Programmable Solvers** - ensures that a developer can create a basic path for cross chain actions (write actions) based on the shared state.<p />

    This results in **fully interoperable applications** for web3. In this paradigm, instead of being a user of "Uniswap on Ethereum," "Uniswap on Polygon," or "Uniswap on Arbitrum," a person simply becomes a **user of Uniswap.**`,
